After upgrading to a new version, you may notice your browser gets stuck at the "loading data" login screen. Close the window/tab and go into your browser settings and delete all the cookies for your URL. You can then log back in and it should work.

Android Chrome:

chrome -> settings -> site settings -> storage -> search for your URL for Home Assistant-> "clear & reset"
