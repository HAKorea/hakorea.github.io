Almost all integrations have external dependencies to communicate with your devices and services. Sometimes Home Assistant is unable to install the necessary dependencies. If this is the case, it should show up in `home-assistant.log`.

The first step is trying to restart Home Assistant and see if the problem persists. If it does, look at the log to see what the error is. If you can't figure it out, please [report it](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/issues) so we can investigate what is going on.
