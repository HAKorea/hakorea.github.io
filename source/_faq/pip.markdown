[Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) should come bundled with the latest Python 3 but is omitted by some distributions. If you are unable to run `python3 -m pip --version` you can install `pip` by [downloading the installer](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and running it with Python 3:

```bash
$ python3 get-pip.py
```
