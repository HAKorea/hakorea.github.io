### Upgrading

Hass.io users can update Home Assistant via the 'Hass.io' panel in the UI. However, please note that Home Assistant updates take some time to roll into the Hass.io builds. Therefore, there is often a slight delay (a day or two) between the availability of a Home Assistant update and the update being available in Hass.io, so be patient. When a Hass.io update is available, it will be shown as a notification in the â€˜Hass.io' panel in the web interface.
