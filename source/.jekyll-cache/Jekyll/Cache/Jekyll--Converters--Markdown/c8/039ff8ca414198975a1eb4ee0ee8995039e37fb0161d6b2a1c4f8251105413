I"<p>The <code>ecovacs</code> integration is the main integration to integrate all <a href="https://www.ecovacs.com">Ecovacs</a> (Deebot) vacuums. You will need your Ecovacs account information (username, password) to discover and control vacuums in your account.</p>
<p>There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#vacuum">Vacuum</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>To add your Ecovacs devices into your Home Assistant installation, add the following to your <code>configuration.yaml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">ecovacs:
  username: YOUR_ECOVACS_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_ECOVACS_PASSWORD
  country: YOUR_TWO_LETTER_COUNTRY_CODE
  continent: YOUR_TWO_LETTER_CONTINENT_CODE
</code></pre>
<div class="config-vars">
  <h3><a class="title-link" name="configuration-variables" href="#configuration-variables"></a> Configuration Variables</h3>
  <dl class=''><dt><a class='title-link' name='username' href='#username'></a> username</dt><dd><p class='desc'><span class='type'>(<span class='string'>string</span>)</span><span class='required'>(Required)</span><span class='description'><p>Your username to login to your Ecovacs account.</p>

</span></p></dd></dl>
</div>
<p>Note: For some countries, you will need to set <code>continent</code> to <code>ww</code> (meaning worldwide.) There is unfortunately no way to know the correct settings other than guessing and checking. See the <a href="https://github.com/wpietri/sucks/blob/master/protocol.md">sucks library protocol documentation</a> for more information about what has been figured out about the Ecovacs servers.</p>
<h3>Stability and Reporting Bugs</h3>
<p>The library that talks to the Ecovacs servers is in a very early state and still under development. As such, it is likely that not all regions and devices will work at the current time.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://github.com/wpietri/sucks">sucks library documentation</a> for some more information about what has been tested, and check out the GitHub issues to see if the issue you’re having is known or being worked on.</p>
<p>If you have an issue with the Ecovacs component, please file a <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/issues">GitHub Issue</a> and include your Home Assistant logs in the report. To get full debug output from both the Ecovacs integration and the underlying <code>sucks</code> library, place this in your <code>configuration.yaml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">logger:
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.ecovacs: debug
    homeassistant.components.vacuum.ecovacs: debug
    sucks: debug
</code></pre>
<p>Warning: doing this will cause your authentication token to visible in your log files. Be sure to remove any tokens and other authentication details from your log before posting them in an issue.</p>
<h2>Vacuum</h2>
<p>The <code>ecovacs</code> vacuum platform allows you to monitor and control your Ecovacs Deebot vacuums.</p>
<h3>Component Lifespans</h3>
<p>The remaining lifespan of components on your Deebot vacuum will be reported as attributes on the vacuum entity. The value will be a whole number representing the percentage of life remaining.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how to extract the filter’s lifespan to its own sensor using a <a href="/integrations/template">template sensor</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      vacuum_filter:
        friendly_name: &quot;Vacuum Filter Remaining Lifespan&quot;
        unit_of_measurement: '%'
        value_template: &quot;{{ state_attr('vacuum.my_vacuum_id', 'component_filter') }}&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if you want a simple binary sensor that becomes <code>On</code> when the filter needs to be replaced (5% or less):</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      vacuum_filter_replace:
        friendly_name: &quot;Vacuum Filter&quot;
        device_class: problem
        value_template: &quot;{{ state_attr('vacuum.my_vacuum_id', 'component_filter') &lt;= 5 }}&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Handling Errors</h3>
<p>The vacuum entity has an <code>error</code> attribute that will contain the <em>most recent</em> error message that came from the vacuum. There is not a comprehensive list of all error messages, so you may need to do some experimentation to determine the error messages that your vacuum can send.</p>
<p>If the vacuum fires a “no error” event, the <code>error</code> attribute will change back to <code>None</code>. Note, however, that this does not happen for all types of errors.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the <code>ecovacs_error</code> event to watch for errors. This event will contain a data payload that looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;entity_id&quot;: &quot;vacuum.deebot_m80&quot;,
  &quot;error&quot;: &quot;an_error_name&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, if a vacuum becomes unavailable (usually due to being idle and off its charger long enough for it to completely power off,) the vacuum’s <code>status</code> attribute will change to <code>offline</code> until it is turned back on.</p>
