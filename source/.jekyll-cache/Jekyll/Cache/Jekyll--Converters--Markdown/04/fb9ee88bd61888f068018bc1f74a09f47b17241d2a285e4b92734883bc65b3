<p>Be aware that <code>emulated_hue</code> doesn‚Äôt work for new users of <strong>Google Home</strong> with <code>emulated_hue</code>. If you‚Äôve not previously set this up and had it working, use the <a href="/integrations/google_assistant/">Google Assistant component</a> or <a href="/integrations/cloud">Nabu Casa cloud</a> component.</p>
</div>
<p>The <code>emulated_hue</code> integration provides a virtual Philips Hue bridge, written entirely in software that allows services that work with the Hue API to interact with Home Assistant
entities. The driving use case behind for functionality is to allow Home Assistant to work with an Amazon Echo or Google Home with no setup cost outside of configuration changes.
The virtual bridge can turn entities on/off or change the brightness of dimmable lights. The volume level of media players can be controlled as brightness.</p>
<div class='note'>
A physical Hue Bridge is required for Philips Hue lights to function - this virtual bridge will not replace a physical bridge. Instead, it allows Home Assistant to represent non-Philips Hue devices to Amazon Echo as Philips Hue devices, which Amazon Echo can control with built-in support.
</div>
<div class='note'>
It is recommended to assign a static IP address to the computer running Home Assistant. This is because the Amazon Echo discovers devices by IP addresses, and if the IP changes, the Echo won't be able to control it. This is easiest done from your router, see your router's manual for details.
</div>
<div class='note'>
<p>Both Google Home and Alexa use the device they were initially set up with for communication with <code>emulated_hue</code>. In other words: if you remove/replace this device you will also break <code>emulated_hue</code>. To recover your <code>emulated_hue</code> functionality, backup your <code>config/emulated_hue_ids.json</code> file, delete the original one and reboot your Home Assistant instance.</p>
<p>If you added or upgraded to a newer Alexa device and devices are not found, you must change to listen_port: 80. If Alexa responds with ‚Äúvalue is out of range for device‚Ä¶‚Äù it means switches were automatically added as lights in discovery. Remove each device in the Alexa app. Turn on all the switches in Home Assistant. In the Alexa app go to ‚ÄúAdd New Device‚Äù select ‚ÄúSwitch‚Äù and then ‚Äúother‚Äù to add them correctly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sleepcycle.com">Sleep Cycle</a> and <a href="https://sleep.urbandroid.org">Sleep as Android</a>: smart alarm clock app can use emulated_hue to turn on and off entities. Sleep Cycle only has it implemented in the iOS app, see <a href="https://support.sleepcycle.com/hc/en-us/articles/207670385-Does-Sleep-Cycle-integrates-with-Phillips-Hue-">Sleep Cycle support</a>. The app requires the same configuration as Google Home and does not work if the type is defined as Alexa in the configuration.</p>
</div>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>To enable the emulated Hue bridge, add one of the following configs to your <code>configuration.yaml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Google Home example configuration.yaml entry
emulated_hue:
  listen_port: 80
  # Google Home does not work on different ports.
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Amazon Echo example configuration.yaml entry
emulated_hue:
  listen_port: 80
  # Amazon Echo/Alexa stopped working on different ports. Search for &quot;Philips Hue Bridge V1 (round)&quot; in the Alexa App to discover devices.
</code></pre>

</div>
<p>A full configuration sample looks like the one below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
emulated_hue:
  host_ip: 192.168.1.186
  listen_port: 8300
  advertise_ip: 10.0.0.10
  advertise_port: 8080
  off_maps_to_on_domains:
    - script
    - scene
  expose_by_default: true
  exposed_domains:
    - light
  entities:
    light.bedroom_light:
      name: &quot;Bedside Lamp&quot;
    light.ceiling_lights:
      hidden: true
</code></pre>
<p>The following are attributes that can be applied in the <code>entities</code> section:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong> (<em>Optional</em>): The name that the emulated Hue will use. The default for this is the entity‚Äôs friendly name.</li>
<li><strong>hidden</strong> (<em>Optional</em>): Whether or not the emulated Hue bridge should expose the entity. Adding <code>hidden: false</code> will expose the entity to Alexa. The default value for this attribute is controlled by the <code>expose_by_default</code> option.</li>
</ul>
<div class='note'>
<p>These attributes used to be found under the <code>customize</code> section of <code>homeassistant</code>, however, they have now been moved to <code>entities</code>. Emulated Hue configuration under <code>homeassistant.customize</code> will be deprecated in the near future.</p>
</div>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>You can verify that the <code>emulated_hue</code> integration has been loaded and is responding by pointing a local browser to the following URL:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>http://&lt;HA IP Address&gt;:80/description.xml</code> - This URL should return a descriptor file in the form of an XML file.</li>
<li><code>http://&lt;HA IP Address&gt;:80/api/pi/lights</code> - This will return a list of devices, lights, scenes, groups, etc.. that <code>emulated_hue</code> is exposing to Alexa.</li>
</ul>
<p>Verify that the URLs above are using port 80, rather than port 8300 (i.e. <code>http://&lt;HA IP Address&gt;:80/description.xml</code>). Both Google Home and Amazon Alexa/Echo (as of the 2019-08 firmware) require port 80.</p>
<h3>Platform specific instructions</h3>
<h4>Hass.io and Docker</h4>
<p>No further actions are required</p>
<h4>Python venv</h4>
<p>An additional step is required to run Home Assistant as a non-root user and use port 80.</p>
<h5>Linux</h5>
<p>On Linux systems (Ubuntu, Debian, etc) execute the following command to allow <code>emulated_hue</code> to use port 80 as a non-root user:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /srv/homeassistant/homeassistant_venv/bin/python3
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that your path may be different depending on your installation method. For example, if you followed the <a href="/docs/installation/virtualenv/">Virtualenv instructions</a>, your path will be <code>/srv/homeassistant/bin/python3</code>.</p>
<h5>FreeBSD and FreeNAS</h5>
<p>On FreeBSD based systems, including FreeNAS, execute the following to allow <code>emulated_hue</code> to use port 80 as a non-root user:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sysctl net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedhigh=0
</code></pre>
<p>You can make this persist by adding the following to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedhigh=0
</code></pre>
