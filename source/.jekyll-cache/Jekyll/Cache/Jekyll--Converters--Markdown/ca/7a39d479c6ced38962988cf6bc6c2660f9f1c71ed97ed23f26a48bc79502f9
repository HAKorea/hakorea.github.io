I"˘<p>Like it how the lights dim up/down at the movies? Do it at home as well!</p>
<p>This example uses the <a href="/integrations/media_player/">media player</a>, <a href="/integrations/light/">lights</a> (transitions) and the <a href="/integrations/sun/">sun</a> integration. We‚Äôll use actions to detect media player state changes and <a href="/integrations/scene/">scenes</a> to control multiple lights and transition between scenes.</p>
<h4>Scenes</h4>
<p>One scene for normal light, one for when movies are on. A 2 second transition gives a nice ‚Äòfeel‚Äô to the switch.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">scene:
  - name: Livingroom normal
    entities:
        light.light1:
            state: on
            transition: 2
            brightness_pct: 60
        light.light2:
            state: on
            transition: 2
            brightness_pct: 85
  - name: Livingroom dim
    entities:
        light.light1:
            state: on
            transition: 2
            brightness_pct: 30
        light.light2:
            state: on
            transition: 2
            brightness_pct: 55
</code></pre>
<h4>Automation</h4>
<p>The paused/stopped state is best matched using ‚Äúfrom: ‚Äòplaying‚Äô‚Äù. Adding in the sun condition as we only want this when it‚Äôs dark.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">automation:
  - alias: &quot;Media player paused/stopped&quot;
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: media_player.htpc
        from: 'playing'
        to: 'idle'
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: sun.sun
        state: 'below_horizon'
    action:
        service: scene.turn_on
        entity_id: scene.livingroom_normal

  - alias: &quot;Media player playing&quot;
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: media_player.htpc
        to: 'playing'
        from: 'idle'
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: sun.sun
        state: 'below_horizon'
    action:
