I"S<p>Set a minimum amount of difference between the temperature read by the sensor specified in the <em>target_sensor</em> option and the target temperature that must change prior to being switched off. For example, if the target temperature is 25 and the tolerance is 0.5 the heater will stop when the sensor equals or goes above 25.5.</p>
