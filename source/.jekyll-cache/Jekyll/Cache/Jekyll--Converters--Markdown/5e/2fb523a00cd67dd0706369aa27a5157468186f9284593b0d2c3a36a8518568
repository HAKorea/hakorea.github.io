I"p<p>Minimum brightness before triggering a problem. In contrast to the other values, this check is <em>not</em> looking at the current situation, but rather at the last days. A problem is only reported if the maximum brightness over the last days was lower than min_brightness. You can use this to check if the plant gets enough light during the course of the day.</p>
