I"<p>This platform allows you to detect presence using <a href="https://www.locative.io/">Locative</a>. Locative is an open source app for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/locative/id725198453?ign-mpt=uo%3D4">iOS</a> that allows users to set up a <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> request when a geofence is entered or exited. This can be configured with Home Assistant to update your location.</p>
<p>Install on your smartphone:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/locative/id725198453?ign-mpt=uo%3D4">iOS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To configure Locative, you must set it up via the integrations panel in the configuration screen. You must set up the app to send a POST request to your Home Assistant server at the webhook URL provided by the integration during setup. When you enter or exit a geofence, Locative will send the appropriate request to that URL, updating Home Assistant. You are not able to specify a device name in Locative. Instead, you will need to look in your <code>dev-state</code> menu for a new device that Locative will have created on it’s first <code>GET</code>. If you had been or are using Owntracks as well, you will need to update the device name used in the Owntracks setup with the name that Locative generated.</p>
