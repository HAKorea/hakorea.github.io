I"8<p>Specify the protocol to be used on the test. Default is TCP and the valid values are TCP or UDP. If your Iperf3 server is located in the Internet, consider to use TCP instead of UDP. If the protocol is set to use UDP, the sensor may not get updated due to package retransmission issues due to its nature.</p>
