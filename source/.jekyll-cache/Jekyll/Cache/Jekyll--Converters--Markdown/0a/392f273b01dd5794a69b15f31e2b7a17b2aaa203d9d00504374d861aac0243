<p>The upgrade process differs depending on the installation you have, so please review the documentation that is specific to your install <a href="/hassio/">Hass.io</a> or <a href="/docs/installation/virtualenv/#upgrading-home-assistant">Virtualenv</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Check whatâ€™s new in the latest version and potentially impacts your system in <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/releases">Home Assistant release notes</a>. It is good practice to review these release notes and pay close attention to the <strong>Breaking Changes</strong> that are listed there. If you havenâ€™t done an update for a while, you should also check previous release notes as they can also contain relevant <strong>Breaking Changes</strong>. <strong>Breaking Changes</strong> may require configuration updates for your components. If you missed this and Home Assistant refuses to start, check the log file in the <a href="/docs/configuration/">configuration</a> directory, e.g., <code>.homeassistant/home-assistant.log</code>, for details about broken components.</p>
<div class='note'>
<p>To avoid permission errors, the upgrade must be run as the same user as the installation was completed, again review the documentation specific to your install <a href="/hassio/">Hass.io</a> or <a href="/docs/installation/virtualenv">Virtualenv</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The default way to update Home Assistant to the latest release, when available, is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pip3 install --upgrade homeassistant
</code></pre>
<p>For a Docker container, simply pull the latest one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo docker pull homeassistant/home-assistant:latest
</code></pre>
<p>For a Raspberry Pi Docker container, simply pull the latest one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo docker pull homeassistant/raspberrypi3-homeassistant:latest
</code></pre>
<p>After updating, you must start/restart Home Assistant for the changes to take effect. This means that you will have to restart <code>hass</code> itself or the <a href="/docs/autostart/">autostarting</a> daemon (if applicable). Startup can take considerable amount of time (i.e. minutes) depending on your device. This is because all requirements are updated as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bruhautomation.io/">BRUH automation</a> has created <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuG2rs1Cl2Y">a tutorial video</a> explaining how to upgrade Home Assistant.</p>
<h4>Run a specific version</h4>
<p>In the event that a Home Assistant version doesnâ€™t play well with your hardware setup, you can downgrade to a previous release:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pip3 install homeassistant==0.XX.X
</code></pre>
<h4>Run the beta version</h4>
<p>If you would like to test next release before anyone else, you can install the beta version released every two weeks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pip3 install --pre --upgrade homeassistant
</code></pre>
<h4>Run the development version</h4>
<p>If you want to stay on the bleeding-edge Home Assistant development branch, you can upgrade to <code>dev</code>.</p>
<div class='note warning'>
  The "dev" branch is likely to be unstable. Potential consequences include loss of data and instance corruption.
</div>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pip3 install --upgrade git+git://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.git@dev
</code></pre>
