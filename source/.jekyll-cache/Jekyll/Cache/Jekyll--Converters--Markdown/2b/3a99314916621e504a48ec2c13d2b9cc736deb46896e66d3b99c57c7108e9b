I"Œ<p>Set a keep-alive interval. If set, the switch specified in the <em>heater</em> option will be triggered every time the interval elapses. Use with heaters and A/C units that shut off if they donâ€™t receive a signal from their remote for a while. Use also with switches that might lose state. The keep-alive call is done with the current valid climate integration state (either on or off).</p>
