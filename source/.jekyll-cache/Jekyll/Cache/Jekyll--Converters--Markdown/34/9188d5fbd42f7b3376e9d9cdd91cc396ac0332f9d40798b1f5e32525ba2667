<h3>Installation of Pianobar</h3>
<p>This media player uses the <a href="https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar">Pianobar command-line Pandora client</a>, which you have to install separately. This can be done on a Raspberry Pi 2/3 with Raspbian Jessie as follows . <em>(Note: Other platforms may have different installation processes)</em></p>
<p>The version of pianobar that comes with Jessie has a bug, so you have to build a more recent version. The latest version depends on a recent version of libraries associated with ffmpeg, so you should make sure you go through the backport process documented in <a href="/integrations/ffmpeg/">The FFmpeg component</a> before doing this. Install the following basic dependencies:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install git libao-dev libgcrypt11-dev libfaad-dev libmad0-dev libjson-c-dev make pkg-config  libcurl4-openssl-dev
</code></pre>
<p>And now install the backported ffmpeg-related libraries (note that if youâ€™re using an older version of ffmpeg for other things on this machine, you may encounter issues after doings this):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get -t jessie-backports install libav-tools libavcodec-extra libavcodec-dev libavfilter-dev libavformat-dev
</code></pre>
<p>Now clone the Pianobar repo and build pianobar:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar.git
cd pianobar
make clean &amp;&amp; make
sudo make install
</code></pre>
<p>Configure Pianobar to auto-login and start playing a station (optional, see <code>man pianobar</code>) by creating and editing the <code>~/.config/pianobar/config</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">password = Password
user = you@youraccount.com
</code></pre>
<p>Test it out by running <code>pianobar</code> in the command line. You should be able to listen to your Pandora stations.</p>
<h3>Configuration in Home Assistant</h3>
<p>The Pandora player can be loaded by adding the following lines to your <code>configuration.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: pandora
</code></pre>
<p>Thatâ€™s it! Now you will find a media player. If you click it you will find all your stations listed as different sources. If you switch to one, the station will begin playing.</p>
