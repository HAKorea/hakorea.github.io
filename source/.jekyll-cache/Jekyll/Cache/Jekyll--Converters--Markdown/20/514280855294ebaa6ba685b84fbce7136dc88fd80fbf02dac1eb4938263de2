I"g<p>Sometimes Google Maps can report GPS locations with a very low accuracy (few kilometers). That can trigger false zoning. Using this parameter, you can filter these false GPS reports. The number has to be in meters. For example, if you put 200 only GPS reports with an accuracy under 200 will be taken into account - Defaults to 100km if not specified.</p>
