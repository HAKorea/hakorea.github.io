I"{	<h2>Supported Z-Wave USB Sticks &amp; Hardware Modules</h2>
<p>You need to have a compatible Z-Wave stick or module installed. This needs to be a <em>static controller</em>, which most Z-Wave sticks and modules will be. If yours is a <em>bridge</em> device then it won’t work with <a href="http://openzwave.com/">OpenZWave</a>, which is what provides Home Assistant’s Z-Wave capabilities. USB sticks using the new 700 series Z-Wave platform are not compatible. The following devices have been confirmed to work:</p>
<div class='note'>
<p>There have <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=245031#p1502030">been reports</a> of the Aeotec stick not working on the Raspberry Pi 4.</p>

<ul>
<li>Aeotec Z-Stick Series 5</li>
<li>Everspring USB stick - Gen 5</li>
<li>Sigma Designs UZB stick</li>
<li>Vision USB stick - Gen5</li>
<li>Zooz Z-Wave Plus S2 stick ZST10</li>
<li>ZWave.me Razberry Board</li>
<li>ZWave.me UZB1 stick</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend that you purchase a <a href="https://z-wavealliance.org/z-wave_plus_certification/">Z-Wave Plus</a> controller, to take advantage of the improvements this provides. As OpenZWave doesn’t support S2 or Smart Start, there’s no need to buy one just for support of these features.</p>
<div class='note'>
  If you're using Hass.io or running Home Assistant in a Docker container, it's recommended to use a USB stick, not a module. Passing a module through Docker is more complicated than passing a USB stick through.

<h2>Stick Alternatives</h2>
<p>The alternative to a stick is a hub that supports Z-Wave. Home Assistant supports the following hubs with Z-Wave support:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/vera/">Vera</a></li>
<li><a href="/integrations/wink/">Wink</a></li>
<li><a href="/integrations/fibaro/">Fibaro</a></li>
<li><a href="/integrations/smartthings/">SmartThings</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Controller Notes</h2>
<h3>Aeotec Stick</h3>
<p>By default this will turn on “disco lights”, which you can turn off by following the instructions in the <a href="/docs/z-wave/device-specific/#aeotec-z-stick">device specific page</a></p>
<h3>Razberry Board</h3>
<p>You need to disable the on-board Bluetooth since the board requires the use of the hardware UART (and there’s only one on the Pi3). You do this by following the instructions in the <a href="/docs/z-wave/device-specific/#razberry-board">device specific page</a></p>
