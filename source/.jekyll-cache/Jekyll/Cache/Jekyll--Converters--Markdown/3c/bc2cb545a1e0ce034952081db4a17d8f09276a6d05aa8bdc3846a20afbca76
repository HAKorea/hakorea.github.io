I"ê<p>You can define a send delay as a fraction of seconds if you experience transmission problems when you try to switch multiple switches at once. This can happen when you use a <a href="https://github.com/pilight/pilight-usb-nano">pilight USB Nano</a> as hardware and switches a whole group of multiple switches on or off. Tested values are between 0.3 and 0.8 seconds depending on the hardware.</p>
