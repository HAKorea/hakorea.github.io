I"Ê!<p>This is a community curated list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) about the installation, setup, and usage of Home Assistant. If you want to get details about a term, please check the <a href="/docs/glossary/">glossary</a>.</p>
<h2>Common</h2>
<h3>Python 2</h3>
<p>There will be no support for Python 2.x. Python 2 will be EOL in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#id2">2020</a> and it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to support a release which was planned to be retired in 2015.</p>
<h3>Releases</h3>
<p>The current release cycle is three weeks. This allows for two weeks of development time and 1 week of beta testing and fixing. Releases usually occur on a Wednesday. There is no fixed time of day when the release will happen because that depends on the person who is finishing the release, it could therefore be Tuesday or Thursday depending on your timezone when its available for you. If there was no announcement made in the previous release notes or on another communication channel then the release will happen.</p>
<p>Beta‚Äôs are normally released on the 2nd Wednesday after the last major release. Please subscribe to the Beta Channel on the <a href="https://discord.gg/RMC8WkX">Home Assistant Discord server</a> for help running beta versions.
When a beta release is in progress, the release notes for it can be found under <a href="https://rc.home-assistant.io/latest-release-notes/">Beta Release Notes</a>.</p>
<p>The release schedule is published in the upcoming events calender on the <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant Developers</a> website.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>My integration does not show up</h3>
<p>When an integration does not show up, many different things can be the case. Before you try any of these steps, make sure to look at the <code>home-assistant.log</code> file and see if there are any errors related to your integration you are trying to set up.</p>
<p>If you have incorrect entries in your configuration files you can use the <code>check_config</code> script to assist in identifying them: <code>hass --script check_config</code>.</p>
<h3>Why are you using YAML for the configuration file?</h3>
<p>And not JSON or XML for the <a href="/docs/configuration/">configuration file</a>? Because <a href="/docs/configuration/yaml/">YAML</a> can be written by hand, you don‚Äôt have to care about commas or tag and it‚Äôs a superset of JSON.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<h3>Documentation tools</h3>
<p>Why are you not using tools X for the documentation? Because the current solution works for us and we see no additional value in using a separate publishing platform.</p>
<h3>Missing Documentation</h3>
<p>Home Assistant is a FAST moving open source project. This means occasionally the official documentation will not be 100% current or complete. Since this is an open source volunteer project, we would encourage anyone who finds gaps in the documentation to click the <code>edit this page on Github</code> link in the top right and submit any corrections/enhancements they may find useful.</p>
<p>In the absence of information, many users find it beneficial to look at other people‚Äôs configurations to find examples of what they want to accomplish in their own configurations. The easiest way to find these configurations is through this <a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ahome-assistant-config&amp;type=Repositories">Github search</a>.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Home Assistant vs. Hass.io</h3>
<p>Home Assistant is a Python program, in simple words. It can be run on various operating systems and provide the ability to track, control and automate your devices. When people talking about Home Assistant they usually refer to a standalone <a href="/docs/installation/">installation method</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/hassio/">Hass.io</a> is a combination of Home Assistant and tools which allows one to run it easily on a Raspberry Pi and other platforms without setting up an operating system first. Hass.io is an all-in one-solution and has a management user interface that can be used from the Home Assistant frontend. This interface is not present in a standalone setup of Home Assistant.</p>
<p>Be aware that add-ons are only available in Hass.io, due to the way Hass.io is installed.</p>
<h3>No module named pip</h3>
<p><a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">Pip</a> should come bundled with the latest Python 3 but is omitted by some distributions. If you are unable to run <code>python3 -m pip --version</code> you can install <code>pip</code> by <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py">downloading the installer</a> and running it with Python 3:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ python3 get-pip.py
</code></pre>
<h3>distutils.errors.DistutilsOptionError</h3>
<p>The problem which leads to <code>distutils.errors.DistutilsOptionError: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both</code> is a known issue if you‚Äôre on a Mac using Homebrew to install Python. Please follow <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Homebrew-and-Python.md#note-on-pip-install---user">these instructions</a> to resolve it.</p>
<h3>libyaml is not found or a compiler error</h3>
<p>On a Debian system, install the Python 3 YAML library by <code>sudo apt-get install python3-yaml</code>.</p>
<h3>pip3: command not found</h3>
<p>This utility should have been installed as part of the Python 3 installation. Check if Python 3 is installed by running <code>python3 --version</code>. If it is not installed, <a href="https://www.python.org/getit/">download it here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are able to successfully run <code>python3 --version</code> but not <code>pip3</code>, install Home Assistant by running the following command instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ python3 -m pip install homeassistant
</code></pre>
<p>On a Debian system, you can also install python3 by <code>sudo apt-get install python3</code> and pip3 by <code>sudo apt-get install python3-pip</code>.</p>
<p>If you run into errors during installation, check that you‚Äôve installed all the necessary prerequisite packages, which include <code>python3-dev</code>, <code>libffi-dev</code>, and <code>libssl-dev</code>. On a Debian-based system, you can install these via <code>apt-get</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
</code></pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>After upgrading, your browser login gets stuck</h3>
<p>After upgrading to a new version, you may notice your browser gets stuck at the ‚Äúloading data‚Äù login screen. Close the window/tab and go into your browser settings and delete all the cookies for your URL. You can then log back in and it should work.</p>
<p>Android Chrome:</p>
<p>chrome -&gt; settings -&gt; site settings -&gt; storage -&gt; search for your URL for Home Assistant-&gt; ‚Äúclear &amp; reset‚Äù</p>
<h3>Connection error</h3>
<p>It can happen that you get a traceback that notify you about connection issues while running Home Assistant. Eg.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused
</code></pre>
<p>The chance is very high that this is not a bug but an issue with the service/daemon itself. Check your network (DNS, DHCP, uplink, etc.) first and make sure that Home Assistant and the service are poperly configured. Keep in mind that webservices can be down.</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>The dependencies which are used by Home Assistant are stored in the folder <code>deps</code> of the <a href="/docs/configuration/">configuration folder</a> directory. After an <a href="/docs/installation/updating/">upgrade</a> the dependences will be upgraded as well.</p>
<h3>Frontend is acting weird</h3>
<p>Close the windows or tab and clear the cache. The frontend is aggressively caching and clearing the cache ensures that the frontend is reloaded when you access it the next time.</p>
<h3>Problems with dependencies</h3>
<p>Almost all integrations have external dependencies to communicate with your devices and services. Sometimes Home Assistant is unable to install the necessary dependencies. If this is the case, it should show up in <code>home-assistant.log</code>.</p>
<p>The first step is trying to restart Home Assistant and see if the problem persists. If it does, look at the log to see what the error is. If you can‚Äôt figure it out, please <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/issues">report it</a> so we can investigate what is going on.</p>
<h3>found character ‚Äô	‚Äô that cannot start any token</h3>
<p>This error means that you used a tab, rather than two spaces. Replace the tab with spaces.</p>
