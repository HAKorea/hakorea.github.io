I"<p>A <a href="/docs/configuration/templating/#processing-incoming-data">template</a> that determines the state of the switch from the value returned by the GET request on the resource URL. This template should compute to a boolean (True or False). If the value is valid JSON, it will be available in the template as the variable <code>value_json</code>. Default is equivalent to <code>'{{ value_json == body_on }}'</code>. This means that by default, the state of the switch is on if and only if the response to the GET request matches.</p>
