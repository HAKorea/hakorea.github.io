When the iPhone is stationary, the interval will eventually be set to <code>max_interval</code> to save battery. When the iPhone starts moving again, the interval will be dynamically updated to 1 min. Note that updating interval to 1 min might be delayed by maximum <code>max_interval</code> minutes. Minimum value is 1 min.</p>
