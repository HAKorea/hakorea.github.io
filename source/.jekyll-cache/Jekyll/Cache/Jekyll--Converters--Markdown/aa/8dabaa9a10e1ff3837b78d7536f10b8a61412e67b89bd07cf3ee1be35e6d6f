I"”<p>As a large amount of users are running <a href="/hassio/">Hass.io</a>, here we are using a Raspberry Pi 3 B and Hass.io 0.70.0 to show how Home Assistant looks from the network side. This is not a full blown investigation, just a quick overview.</p>
<p>The IP address of the Home Assistant machine is 192.168.0.215. The system which is the source of the scans is a machine running Fedora 27 and Nmap 7.60 is used to perform the port scans. Both systems are in the same network.</p>
<h2>SSH server Add-on</h2>
<p>To get access to Hass.io in secure way, SSH is provided by the <a href="/addons/ssh/">SSH server add-on</a>.</p>

<p>That port 22 and 8123 are open was expected. On port 22222 is an additional SSH server running. This port is for <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/hassio_debugging.html">debugging</a> and supports only a login with a key. This means that you would need to remove the SD card from your Raspberry Pi, create an <code>authorized_keys</code> with your SSH public key in it and put the SD Card back in your Pi to get access.</p>

<p>To secure MQTT to consider to use certificates and to specify users with password under <code>logins:</code> at least. Use port 1883 only in your local network.</p>
<h2>Samba Add-on</h2>
<p>The <a href="/addons/samba/">Samba add-on</a> enables one to use a Windows system to access the configuration and other shares. Per default there is no user set. To increase your local security we strongly suggest that you set a username and a password and donâ€™t allow guests. A sample configuration could look like the one below.</p>
<p>A port scan for Hass.io with this add-on will give you the details.</p>
