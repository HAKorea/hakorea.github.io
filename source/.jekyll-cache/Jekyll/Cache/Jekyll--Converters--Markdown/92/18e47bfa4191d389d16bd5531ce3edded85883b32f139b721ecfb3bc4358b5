I"ú<p><a href="https://almond.stanford.edu/">Almond</a> is an open, privacy-preserving virtual assistant by <a href="https://oval.cs.stanford.edu/">Stanford Open Virtual Assistant Lab</a>. It allows you, among other things, to control Home Assistant using natural language. Once installed, it will be available on Lovelace via the microphone icon in the top right.</p>
<p>Almond consists of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almond Server: Knows about Home Assistant and your data. Executes your sentences.</li>
<li>LUInet: Neural network that converts your sentences into Thingtalk programs.</li>
<li>Thingpedia: Skills that provide the building blocks for Thingtalk programs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Hass.io installation</h3>
<p>To install Almond Server on Hass.io, go to Hass.io App Store, search for Almond and click on Install. Once started, it will initiate a config flow to finish set up in Home Assistant. You can find it on the integrations page in the configuration panel.</p>
<h3>Manual installation</h3>
<p>You can install Almond Server by following <a href="https://github.com/stanford-oval/almond-server#running-almond-server">the instructions in their README</a>.</p>
<p>Before linking it to Home Assistant, you will need to visit the Almond UI once to create a password. It is by default available on port 3000.</p>
<p>Once installed, configure Almond like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
almond:
  type: local
  host: http://127.0.0.1:3000
</code></pre>
<p>The Almond integration does not update config entries yet. If you make a change to configuration.yaml, you will need to remove the config entry and then restart Home Assistant.</p>
<h3>Almond Web</h3>
<p>Stanford offers a hosted version of Almond Server called Almond Web. To use this, go to the integrations page and add Almond using the add integration flow.</p>
<p>Your Home Assistant installation needs to be externally accessible if you want Almond Web to be able to control Home Assistant.</p>
<h3>Almond Web - Manual installation</h3>
<p>It is possible to set up Almond Web manually. You will need to create your own client ID and secret in the web interface.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
almond:
  type: oauth2
  client_id: AAAAAAAAAAAAA
  client_secret: BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
</code></pre>
<p>You can now go to the integrations page and start the configuration flow.</p>
<h2>Language Support</h2>
<p>Almond is currently limited to the English language. This is not a technical limitation but requires specialized engineering effort. Almond has currently no public timeline for adding other languages.</p>
<h2>Device Support</h2>
<p>Almond is constantly improving. It does not currently support all devices, but weâ€™re working with Almond on improving this.</p>
