File URLs only work if Home Assistant and the GNTP server are running on the same machine. If no <code>app_icon</code> is set a local copy of the Home Assistant logo will be used. If you choose to use an HTTP URL please make the maximum image size 150 px by 150 px as Growl for Mac will sometimes timeout when registering.</p>
