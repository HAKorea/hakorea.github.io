I"^<p>Control the output drive level of the GPIO. Each GPIO can be configured independently to one of the four possible output current levels. By programming these bits, the user is changing the number of transistor pairs or ‘fingers’ that drive the I/O pad. Options are <code>0.25</code>, <code>0.5</code>, <code>0.75</code>, <code>1.0</code>.</p>
