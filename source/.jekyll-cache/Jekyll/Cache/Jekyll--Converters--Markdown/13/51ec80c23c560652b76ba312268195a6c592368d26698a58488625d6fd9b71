I"(	<p>When the Z-Wave mesh is first started, the controller will go through all the following stages for every device on the mesh. This is a slow process, and to complete requires that the devices be awake. While devices that are mains or USB powered are always awake, battery-powered devices spend most of their time asleep. Because of this, you can expect that after startup your battery powered devices will spend time in <code>Initializing (CacheLoad)</code> - how long depends on the device.</p>
<p>Your devices will still function normally while marked as <code>Initializing</code>.</p>
