I"Ú<p>Filter by direction of the departure. For Tram, Bus, SEV, and S-Bahn, direction = direction. For U-Bahn trains, directions are more general. For U1, U2, U3 and U6, direction=â€˜1â€™ indicates south-bound trains, direction=â€˜2â€™ indicates northbound trains. For U4 and U5, direction=â€˜1â€™ indicates east-bound trains, direction=â€˜2â€™ indicates west-bound trains. For example, setting directions: â€˜1â€™ can be used to get all south-bound trains at Scheidplatz.</p>
