I"¾<p>If specified and Life360 does not provide an update for a member within that maximum time window, an event named <code>life360_update_overdue</code> will be fired with the <code>entity_id</code> of the corresponding memberâ€™s device_tracker entity. Once an update does come, an event named <code>life360_update_restored</code> will be fired with the <code>entity_id</code> of the corresponding memberâ€™s device_tracker entity and another data item named <code>wait</code> that will indicate the amount of time spent waiting for the update. You can use these events in automations to be notified when they occur. See <a href="#example-overdue-update-automations">example automations</a> below.</p>
