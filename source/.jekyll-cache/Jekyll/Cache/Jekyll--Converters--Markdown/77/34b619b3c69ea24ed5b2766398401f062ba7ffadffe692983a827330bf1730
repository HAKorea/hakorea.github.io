I"9<p>iCloud location updates come with some gps_accuracy varying from 10 to 5000 meters. This setting defines the accuracy threshold in meters for a location update. Less accurate updates will be discarded by this tracker. This allows for more precise location monitoring and fewer false-positive zone changes.</p>
