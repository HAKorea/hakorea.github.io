I"ƒ<p>Owntracks users can define <a href="https://owntracks.org/booklet/features/waypoints/">waypoints</a> (a.k.a regions) which are similar in spirit to Home Assistant zones. If this configuration variable is <code>true</code>, the Owntracks users who are in <code>waypoint_whitelist</code> can export waypoints from the device and Home Assistant will import them as zone definitions.</p>
