These options are being phased out and are only available for single platform integrations.
</div>
<p>Some integrations or platforms (those that are based on the <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/blob/dev/homeassistant/helpers/entity.py">entity</a> class) allows various extra options to be set.</p>
<h3>Entity namespace</h3>
<p>By setting an entity namespace, all entities will be prefixed with that namespace. That way <code>light.bathroom</code> can become <code>light.holiday_house_bathroom</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: your_lights
    entity_namespace: holiday_house
</code></pre>
<h3>Scan Interval</h3>
<p>Platforms that require polling will be polled in an interval specified by the main component. For example a light will check every 30 seconds for a changed state. It is possible to overwrite this scan interval for any platform that is being polled by specifying a <code>scan_interval</code> configuration key. In the example below we set up the <code>your_lights</code> platform but tell Home Assistant to poll the devices every 10 seconds instead of the default 30 seconds.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry to poll your_lights every 10 seconds.
light:
  - platform: your_lights
    scan_interval: 10
</code></pre>
