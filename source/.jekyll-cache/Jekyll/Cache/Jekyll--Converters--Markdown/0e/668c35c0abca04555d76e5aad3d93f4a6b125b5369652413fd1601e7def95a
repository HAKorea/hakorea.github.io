I"¤<p>The list of rooms that the bot should join and listen for commands (see below) in. While you can limit the list of rooms that a certain command applies to on a per-command basis (see below), you must still list all rooms here that commands should be received in. Rooms can be given either by their internal ID (e.g., â€˜!cURbafjkfsMDVwdRDQ:matrix.orgâ€™) or any of their aliases (e.g., â€˜#matrix:matrix.orgâ€™).</p>
