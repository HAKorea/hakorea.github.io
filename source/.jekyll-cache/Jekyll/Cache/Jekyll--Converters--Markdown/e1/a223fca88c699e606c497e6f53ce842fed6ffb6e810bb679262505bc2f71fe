I"ñ<p>Home Assistant is a FAST moving open source project. This means occasionally the official documentation will not be 100% current or complete. Since this is an open source volunteer project, we would encourage anyone who finds gaps in the documentation to click the <code>edit this page on Github</code> link in the top right and submit any corrections/enhancements they may find useful.</p>
<p>In the absence of information, many users find it beneficial to look at other peopleâ€™s configurations to find examples of what they want to accomplish in their own configurations. The easiest way to find these configurations is through this <a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ahome-assistant-config&amp;type=Repositories">Github search</a>.</p>
