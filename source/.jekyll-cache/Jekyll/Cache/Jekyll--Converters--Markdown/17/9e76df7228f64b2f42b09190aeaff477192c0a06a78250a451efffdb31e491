I"°<p>The System Health integration provides an API to offer information on the system and its components. It also allows to run diagnostic tools to diagnose problems.</p>
<p>This integration is by default enabled, unless you‚Äôve disabled or removed the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/default_config/"><code>default_config:</code></a> line from your configuration. If that is the case, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
system_health:
</code></pre>
<p>System Health integration data can be viewed in Developer Tools on the ‚ÄúInfo‚Äù tab.</p>
