<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>Hass.io users can update Home Assistant via the â€˜Hass.ioâ€™ panel in the UI. However, please note that Home Assistant updates take some time to roll into the Hass.io builds. Therefore, there is often a slight delay (a day or two) between the availability of a Home Assistant update and the update being available in Hass.io, so be patient. When a Hass.io update is available, it will be shown as a notification in the â€˜Hass.ioâ€™ panel in the web interface.</p>
