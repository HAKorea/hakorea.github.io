I"m<p>The <code>arwn</code> sensor platform is a client for the <a href="https://github.com/sdague/arwn">Ambient Radio Weather Network</a> project. This collects weather station data and makes it available in an MQTT subtree.</p>
<p>To use your ARWN setup, you must already have configured the <a href="/integrations/mqtt/">MQTT</a> platform. Then add the following to your <code>configuration.yaml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: arwn
</code></pre>
<p>Currently all temperatures, barometers, moisture, rain, and wind sensors will be displayed.</p>
