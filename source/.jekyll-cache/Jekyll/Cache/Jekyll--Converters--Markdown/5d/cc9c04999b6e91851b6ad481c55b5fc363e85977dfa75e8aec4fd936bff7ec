I"Ü<p>This is the string that is used to identify which devices are to be assumed to be sensors instead of lights of switches. If this string is found in the device name or folder, Home Assistant will assume it is as a sensor or binary sensor (if the device has on/off or true/false states). This is only necessary for nodes that are not automatically detected as sensors by Home Assistant. Insteon door, window, motion and leak sensors should all be detected automatically.</p>
