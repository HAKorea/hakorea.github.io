I"6<p>If you already have Python 3.7 or later installed, you can easily give Home Assistant a spin.</p>
<p>It’s recommended when installing Python packages that you use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/venv.html#module-venv">virtual environment</a>. This will make sure that your Python installation and Home Assistant installation won’t impact one another. The following steps will work on most UNIX like systems.</p>
<div class='note'>
<p>This is a generic guide for running Home Assistant under Python. We recommend to use <a href="/docs/installation/#recommended">our recommended installation guides</a>. The steps below may be shorter but some users find difficulty when applying updates and may run into issues.</p>
<p>Before you begin the guide below, ensure that you have a <em>so-called standard</em> build environment that includes things like <code>make</code>, <code>gcc</code>, <code>python3</code>, including Python 3 <code>setuptools</code> and <code>pip</code> modules. Less obvious is the need to install <code>openssl-dev</code> (for opensslv.h) and <code>libffi-dev</code> (for cffi.h) for things to build later on.</p>
</div>
<h3>Install</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a virtual environment in your current directory:
<pre><code class="language-bash">python3 -m venv homeassistant
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Open the virtual environment:
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd homeassistant
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Activate the virtual environment:
<pre><code class="language-bash">source bin/activate
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Install Home Assistant:
<pre><code class="language-bash">python3 -m pip install homeassistant
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Run Home Assistant:
<pre><code class="language-bash">hass --open-ui
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>You can now reach the web interface on <code>http://ipaddress:8123/</code> - the first start may take a couple of minutes before the web interface is available. This can take longer if you’re using lower-end hardware like a Raspberry Pi Zero.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Upgrade</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Stop Home Assistant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the directory where the virtual environment is located, activate the virtual environment, then upgrade Home Assistant:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd homeassistant
source bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade homeassistant
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start Home Assistant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now reach the web interface on <code>http://ipaddress:8123/</code> - the first start may take some time before the web interface is available, depending on how many integrations need to be upgraded.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Run a specific version</h3>
<p>In the event that a Home Assistant version doesn’t play well with your hardware setup, you can downgrade to a previous release. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd homeassistant
source bin/activate
pip3 install homeassistant==0.XX.X
</code></pre>
<h4>Run the beta version</h4>
<p>If you would like to test next release before anyone else, you can install the beta version, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd homeassistant
source bin/activate
pip3 install --pre --upgrade homeassistant
</code></pre>
<h4>Run the development version</h4>
<p>If you want to stay on the bleeding-edge Home Assistant development branch, you can upgrade to <code>dev</code>.</p>
<div class='note warning'>
  The "dev" branch is likely to be unstable. Potential consequences include loss of data and instance corruption.
</div>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd homeassistant
source bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade git+git://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.git@dev
</code></pre>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the future, if you want to start Home Assistant manually again, follow step 2, 3 and 5.</li>
<li>It’s recommended to run Home Assistant as a dedicated user.</li>
<li>If you want Home Assistant to automatically start at boot, check the <a href="/docs/autostart/">autostart docs</a></li>
</ul>

</div>
<h3>After upgrading Python</h3>
<p>If you’ve upgraded Python (for example, you were running 3.7.1 and now you’ve installed 3.7.3) then you’ll need to build a new virtual environment. Simply rename your existing virtual environment directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mv homeassistant homeassistant.old
</code></pre>
<p>Then follow the <a href="#install">Install</a> steps again, being sure to use the newly installed version of Python.</p>
