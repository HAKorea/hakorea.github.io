I"q<p>A list of mappings from source friendly name to the source code (e.g. <code>TV:'05'</code>). Valid source codes depend on the receiver (some known codes can be found below). Codes must be defined as strings (between single or double quotation marks) so that <code>05</code> is not implicitly transformed to <code>5</code>, which wouldnâ€™t be valid source code.</p>
