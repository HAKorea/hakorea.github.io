I"a<p>This integration sets up integration with <a href="https://www.geofency.com/">Geofency</a>. Geofency is a paid app for iOS that lets users to configure a request that will be sent when a geofence or iBeacon region is entered or exited. This can be configured with Home Assistant to update your location.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>To configure Geofency, you must set it up via the integrations panel in the configuration screen. You must then configure the iOS app (via the Webhook feature) to send a POST request to your Home Assistant server at the webhook URL provided by the integration during setup. Use the default POST format. Make sure to enable the ‘Update Geo-Position’ functionality for mobile beacons.</p>
<p>Geofency will automatically generate the device tracker name used for geofences, and you will find it in the integrations section after the first request. For beacons, the device name will be <code>beacon_&lt;name from Geofency&gt;</code>, e.g., <code>device_tracker.beacon_car</code>.</p>
<p>When using mobile beacons (optional) an entry in <code>configuration.yaml</code> is still needed as this can’t be added via the integrations panel.</p>

<p>A sample configuration for the <code>geofency</code> integration when using mobile beacons is shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
geofency:
  mobile_beacons:
    - car
    - keys
</code></pre>
<h3>Zones</h3>
<p>When you enter a geofence or stationary beacon, your location name in Home Assistant will be set to the name of the geofence or beacon location in Geofency. When you exit a geofence or stationary beacon, your location name in Home Assistant will be set to <code>not home</code>. For mobile beacons, the location name will be <code>not_home</code> whenever the beacon is entered or exited outside of a <a href="/integrations/zone/">zone</a>, otherwise, it will be set to the name of the zone.</p>
<p>To make Geofency work better with the <a href="/integrations/proximity/">proximity</a> component, you should enable the ‘Send Current Location’ feature in the Webhook configuration screen. This ensures that the <em>current</em> GPS coordinates are included in exit events instead of the coordinates of the (center of) the zone that was exited.</p>
