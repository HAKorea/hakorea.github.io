I"∞<p>To run Jupyter Notebooks locally, an installation of <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> is needed. Consider running Jupyter in a <a href="/docs/installation/virtualenv/">virtualenv</a> in order to properly manage dependencies.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ pip3 install jupyter matplotlib
</code></pre>
<div class='note warning'>
<p>Certain notebooks hosted in the <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-notebooks">Home Assistant notebooks repository</a> require access to a running Home Assistant instance or parts of a Home Assistant installation. If you want to run those notebooks, install Home Assistant with <code>$ pip3 install homeassistant</code> as well.</p>
</div>
<p>Run Jupyter from the command line.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ jupyter notebook
[I 17:22:18.081 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /run/user/1000/jupyter/notebook_cookie_secret
[I 17:22:18.921 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/fabaff/home-assistant
[I 17:22:18.921 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels 
[I 17:22:18.921 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/
[I 17:22:18.922 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
</code></pre>
<p>Open <code>http://localhost:8888/</code> in your browser. Press ‚ÄúNew‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúPython3‚Äù to open a new notebook.</p>

</p>
<p>You will get an empty notebook with one cell. Cells can contain code or text. To get the output of a cell you need to execute them with ‚ÄúCell‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúRun Cells‚Äù from the menu or by pressing the Play icon.</p>

</p>
<p>The downloadable version of this notebook is available in the <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-notebooks/blob/master/other/first-notebook.ipynb">Home Assistant notebooks repository</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see is the Jupyter notebook workflow is very similar to working directly with a Python shell. One advantage of notebooks is that you can go back and forth between cells as you please and save your work.</p>
