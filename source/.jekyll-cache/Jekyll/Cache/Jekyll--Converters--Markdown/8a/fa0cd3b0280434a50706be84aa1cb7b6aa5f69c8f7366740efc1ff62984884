I"¾<p>The <code>zeroconf</code> integration will scan the network for supported devices and services. Discovered integrations will show up in the discovered section on the integrations page in the config panel. It will also make Home Assistant discoverable for other services in the network. Zeroconf is also sometimes known as Bonjour, Rendezvous, and Avahi.</p>
<p>Integrations can opt-in to be found by adding either <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/next/creating_integration_manifest.html#zeroconf">a Zeroconf section</a> or <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/next/creating_integration_manifest.html#homekit">a HomeKit section</a> to their manifest.json.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>

If that is the case, and you wish to have Home Assistant scan for integrations using zeroconf and HomeKit, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:</p>
