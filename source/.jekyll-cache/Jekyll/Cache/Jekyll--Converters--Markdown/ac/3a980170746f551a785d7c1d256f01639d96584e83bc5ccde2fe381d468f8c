I"r<p>A list of 1 to 16 colors, used in the effect loop (see example below). Defined as three comma-separated integers between 0 and 255 that represent the color in RGB. There is no way to set brightness, but you can define lower RGB values to simulate lower brightness. E.g., if you want 50% red, define it as <code>[127,0,0]</code> instead of <code>[255,0,0]</code>.</p>
