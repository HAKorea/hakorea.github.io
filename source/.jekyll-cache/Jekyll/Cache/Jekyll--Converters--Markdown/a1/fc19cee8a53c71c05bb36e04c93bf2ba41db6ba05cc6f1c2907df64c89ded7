<h2>Updating your configuration to use the editor</h2>
<p>The script editor reads and writes to the file <code>scripts.yaml</code> in your <a href="/docs/configuration/">configuration</a> folder. Make sure that you have set up the script integration to read from it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Configuration.yaml example
script: !include scripts.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>The content that was under <code>script:</code> should now be moved to <code>scripts.yaml</code> to be editable.</p>
