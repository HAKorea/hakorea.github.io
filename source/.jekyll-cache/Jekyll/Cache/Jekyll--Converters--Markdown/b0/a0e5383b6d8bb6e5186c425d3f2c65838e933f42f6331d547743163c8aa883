I"¥<p>The <code>waqi</code> sensor platform will query <a href="https://aqicn.org/city/beijing/">World Air Quality Index</a> service to check AQI value for a specific set of locations. The resulting indexes will be added to the Home Assistant as sensor outputs.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>This sensor requires an API token. Please obtain one at <a href="https://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/#/">AQICN API token</a>.</p>
<p>The locations field is a search for a location. E.g., ‚Äúbrisbane‚Äù or ‚ÄúBrisban‚Äù would find Brisbane, Australia and all associated stations in the area.</p>
<p>The format for station fields is exactly from the website, e.g., you would provide the location string ‚Äú<a href="http://aqicn.org/city/australia/queensland/south-brisbane/">South Brisbane, Australia</a>‚Äù for the linked location.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your <code>configuration.yaml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: waqi
    token: AQICN_API_TOKEN
    locations:
      - beijing
</code></pre>

</span></p></dd></dl>
</div>
<p>The value reported is an overall AQ index for the location. The values of the index can be interpreted as following:</p>
