<p><a href="https://manything.com">Manything</a> is a smart app that turns your Android device, iPhone, iPod, or iPad into a WiFi camera for monitoring your home, your pets, anything! Comes with live streaming, motion activated alerts, cloud video recording, and more.</p>
<p>To get manything support, HA will use IFTTT’s <a href="https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks">Webhooks Service</a> and the <a href="https://ifttt.com/manything">ManyThing Service</a>. Use the <a href="/integrations/ifttt/">IFTTT Setup instructions</a> to activate the IFTTT Platform.</p>
<p>After setting up IFTTT, Maker Service and ManyThing Service, you can use the following examples to configure Home Assistant.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
automation:
  - alias: 'ManyThing Recording ON'
    # This calls an IFTTT recipe to turn on recording of the ManyThing Camera
    # if we leave the house during the day.
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: all
        to: 'not_home'
    condition:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sun.sun
        state: 'above_horizon'
    action:
      service: ifttt.trigger
      data: {&quot;event&quot;:&quot;manything_on&quot;}

  - alias: 'ManyThing Recording OFF'
    # This calls an IFTTT recipe to turn off recording of the ManyThing Camera
    # when we get home unless it's nighttime.
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: all
        to: 'home'
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: sun.sun
        state: 'above_horizon'
    action:
      service: ifttt.trigger
      data: {&quot;event&quot;:&quot;manything_off&quot;}
</code></pre>
<h3>Setting up a recipe</h3>
<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/integrations/ifttt/IFTTT_manything_trigger.png' />
You need to setup a unique trigger for each event you sent to IFTTT.
For ManyThing support, you need to set up an `on` and `off` event.
</p>
<h3>Testing your trigger</h3>
<p>You can use the developer tools to test your <a href="https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks">Maker Service</a> trigger. To do this, open the Home Assistant UI, open the sidebar, click on the first icon in the developer tools. This should get you to the ‘Call Service’ screen. Fill in the following values:</p>
<table>
