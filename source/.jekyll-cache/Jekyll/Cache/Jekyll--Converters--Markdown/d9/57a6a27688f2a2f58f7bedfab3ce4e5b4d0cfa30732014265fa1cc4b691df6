I"†<p>The duration to heat the hotplate in milliseconds for gas resistance measurements as described in the sensor datasheet.  Can be between 1-4032 ms. In reality, you will likely need between 80-100ms to reach a stable temperature.  Using a duration greater than 1000ms is inadvisable as it will essentially result in the heater being continually on due to the 1-second update interval.</p>
