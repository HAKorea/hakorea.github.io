I"è<p>Device Automations is a plugin for the automation integration to allow other integrations to provide device specific triggers, conditions and actions.</p>
<p>There is no device automation specific configuration. Instead, it is configured as part of the normal automations.</p>
<p>Device automations are meant to be configured via the UI.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">- id: &quot;123456789&quot;
  alias: Light turns off
  trigger:
    - platform: device
      device_id: 7a92d5ee74014a0b86903fc669b0bcd6
      domain: light
      type: turn_off
      entity_id: light.bowl
  action:
    - service: camera.turn_off
</code></pre>
