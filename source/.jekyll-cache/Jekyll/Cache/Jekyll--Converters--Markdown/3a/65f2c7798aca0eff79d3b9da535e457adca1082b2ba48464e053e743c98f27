I"€<p>How often (in days) the purge task runs. If a scheduled purge is missed (e.g., if Home Assistant was not running), the schedule will resume soon after Home Assistant restarts. You can use the <a href="#service-purge">service</a> call <code>purge</code> when required without impacting the purge schedule. If this is set to <code>0</code> (zero), automatic purging is disabled.</p>
