E.g., having <code>myhass</code> as the namespace will cause the device tracker metrics to be <code>myhass_device_tracker_state</code>, the switch metrics to be <code>myhass_switch_state</code> and so on. The default is to not add any prefix to the metrics name. (available in version 0.73.0 and later)</p>
