I"Å<p>When an integration does not show up, many different things can be the case. Before you try any of these steps, make sure to look at the <code>home-assistant.log</code> file and see if there are any errors related to your integration you are trying to set up.</p>
<p>If you have incorrect entries in your configuration files you can use the <code>check_config</code> script to assist in identifying them: <code>hass --script check_config</code>.</p>
