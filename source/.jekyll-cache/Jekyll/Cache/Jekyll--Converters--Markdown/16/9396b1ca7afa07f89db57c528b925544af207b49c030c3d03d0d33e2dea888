I"×<p>The total expected precipitation/rain in mm within the given time-frame. The total expected rain in the configured time-frame will be equal to <em>precipitation_forecast_total</em>/<em>timeframe</em> mm/min. So, with time-frame configured to 30 minutes and a value of 5, the expected rain is 5 mm in 30 minutes, which is the same as 10 mm/h. If time-frame is set to 90 minutes and a value of 5, the expected rain is 5 mm in 90 minutes, which is equal to 3.3 mm/h.</p>
