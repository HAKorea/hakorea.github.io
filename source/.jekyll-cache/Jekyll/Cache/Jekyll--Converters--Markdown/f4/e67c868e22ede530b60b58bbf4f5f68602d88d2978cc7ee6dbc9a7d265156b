I"<p>Whether or not entities should be exposed via the bridge by default instead of explicitly (see the ‘emulated_hue’ customization below). Warning: If you have a lot of devices (more than 49 total across all exposed domains), you should be careful with this option. Exposing more devices than Alexa supports can result in it not seeing any of them. If you are having trouble getting any devices to show up, try disabling this, and explicitly exposing just a few devices at a time to see if that fixes it.</p>
