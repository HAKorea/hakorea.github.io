I"ã<p>This example integration will detect intruders. It does so by checking if lights are being turned on while there is no one at home. When this happens it will turn the lights red, flash them for 30 seconds and send a message via <a href="/integrations/notify/">the notify integration</a>. It will also flash a specific light when a known person comes home.</p>
<p>This integration depends on the integrations <a href="/integrations/device_tracker/">device_tracker</a> and <a href="/integrations/light/">light</a> being setup.</p>
<p>To set it up, add the following lines to your <code>configuration.yaml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
simple_alarm:
  known_light: light.Bowl
  unknown_light: group.living_room
</code></pre>
<div class="config-vars">
  <h3><a class="title-link" name="configuration-variables" href="#configuration-variables"></a> Configuration Variables</h3>
