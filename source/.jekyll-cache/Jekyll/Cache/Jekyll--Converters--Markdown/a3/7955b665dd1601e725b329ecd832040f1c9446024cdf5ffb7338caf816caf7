I"ç8<p>So you‚Äôve been using Home Assistant for a while now and your configuration.yaml file brings people to tears or you simply want to start off with the distributed approach, here‚Äôs how to ‚Äúsplit the configuration.yaml‚Äù into more manageable (read: humanly readable) pieces.</p>
<p>First off, several community members have sanitized (read: without api keys/passwords etc) versions of their configurations available for viewing, you can see a list of them <a href="/cookbook/#example-configurationyaml">here</a>.</p>
<p>As commenting code doesn‚Äôt always happen, please read on for the details.</p>
<p>Now despite the logical assumption that the <code>configuration.yaml</code> will be replaced by this process it will in fact remain, albeit in a much less cluttered form.</p>
<p>In this lighter version we will still need what could be called the core snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">homeassistant:
  # Name of the location where Home Assistant is running
  name: My Home Assistant Instance
  # Location required to calculate the time the sun rises and sets
  latitude: 37
  longitude: -121
  # 'metric' for Metric, 'imperial' for Imperial
  unit_system: imperial
  # Pick yours from here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
  time_zone: America/Los_Angeles
  customize: !include customize.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>Note that each line after <code>homeassistant:</code> is indented two (2) spaces. Since the configuration files in Home Assistant are based on the YAML language, indentation and spacing are important. Also note that seemingly strange entry under <code>customize:</code>.</p>
<p><code>!include filename.yaml</code> is the statement that tells Home Assistant to insert the contents of <code>filename.yaml</code> at that point. This is how we are going to break a monolithic and hard to read file (when it gets big) into more manageable chunks.</p>
<p>Now before we start splitting out the different components, let‚Äôs look at the other integrations (in our example) that will stay in the base file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">history:
frontend:
logbook:
http:
  api_password: ImNotTelling!

ifttt:
  key: [nope]

wink:
  access_token: [wouldn't you]
  refresh_token: [like to know]

zwave:
  usb_path: /dev/ttyUSB0
  config_path: /usr/local/share/python-openzwave/config
  polling_interval: 10000

mqtt:
  broker: 127.0.0.1
</code></pre>
<p>As with the core snippet, indentation makes a difference. The integration headers (<code>mqtt:</code>) should be fully left aligned (aka no indent), and the parameters (<code>broker:</code>) should be indented two (2) spaces.</p>
<p>While some of these integrations can technically be moved to a separate file they are so small or ‚Äúone off‚Äôs‚Äù where splitting them off is superfluous. Also, you‚Äôll notice the # symbol (hash/pound). This represents a ‚Äúcomment‚Äù as far as the commands are interpreted. Put another way, any line prefixed with a <code>#</code> will be ignored. This makes breaking up files for human readability really convenient, not to mention turning off features while leaving the entry intact.</p>
<p>Now, lets assume that a blank file has been created in the Home Assistant configuration directory for each of the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">automation.yaml
zone.yaml
sensor.yaml
switch.yaml
device_tracker.yaml
customize.yaml
</code></pre>
<p><code>automation.yaml</code> will hold all the automation integration details. <code>zones.yaml</code> will hold the zone integration details and so forth. These files can be called anything but giving them names that match their function will make things easier to keep track of.</p>
<p>Inside the base configuration file add the following entries:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">automation: !include automation.yaml
zone: !include zone.yaml
sensor: !include sensor.yaml
switch: !include switch.yaml
device_tracker: !include device_tracker.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>Note that there can only be one <code>!include:</code> for each integration so chaining them isn‚Äôt going to work. If that sounds like Greek, don‚Äôt worry about it.</p>
<p>Alright, so we‚Äôve got the single integrations and the include statements in the base file, what goes in those extra files?</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at the <code>device_tracker.yaml</code> file from our example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">- platform: owntracks
- platform: nmap_tracker
  hosts: 192.168.2.0/24
  home_interval: 3

  track_new_devices: true
  interval_seconds: 40
  consider_home: 120
</code></pre>
<p>This small example illustrates how the ‚Äúsplit‚Äù files work. In this case, we start with two (2) device tracker entries (<code>owntracks</code> and <code>nmap</code>). These files follow <a href="/getting-started/devices/#style-2-list-each-device-separately">‚Äústyle 1‚Äù</a> that is to say a fully left aligned leading entry (<code>- platform: owntracks</code>) followed by the parameter entries indented two (2) spaces.</p>
<p>This (large) sensor configuration gives us another example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">### sensor.yaml
### METEOBRIDGE #############################################
- platform: tcp
  name: 'Outdoor Temp (Meteobridge)'
  host: 192.168.2.82
  timeout: 6
  payload: &quot;Content-type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8\n\n&quot;
  value_template: &quot;{{value.split (' ')[2]}}&quot;
  unit: C
- platform: tcp
  name: 'Outdoor Humidity (Meteobridge)'
  host: 192.168.2.82
  port: 5556
  timeout: 6
  payload: &quot;Content-type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8\n\n&quot;
  value_template: &quot;{{value.split (' ')[3]}}&quot;
  unit: Percent

#### STEAM FRIENDS ##################################
- platform: steam_online
  api_key: [not telling]
  accounts:
      - 76561198012067051

#### TIME/DATE ##################################
- platform: time_date
  display_options:
      - 'time'
      - 'date'
- platform: worldclock
  time_zone: Etc/UTC
  name: 'UTC'
- platform: worldclock
  time_zone: America/New_York
  name: 'Ann Arbor'
</code></pre>
<p>You‚Äôll notice that this example includes a secondary parameter section (under the steam section) as well as a better example of the way comments can be used to break down files into sections.</p>
<p>That about wraps it up.</p>
<p>If you have issues checkout <code>home-assistant.log</code> in the configuration directory as well as your indentations. If all else fails, head over to our <a href="https://discord.gg/c5DvZ4e">Discord chat server</a> and ask away.</p>
<h3>Debugging multiple configuration files</h3>
<p>If you have many configuration files, the <code>check_config</code> script allows you to see how Home Assistant interprets them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listing all loaded files: <code>hass --script check_config --files</code></li>
<li>Viewing a component‚Äôs config: <code>hass --script check_config --info light</code></li>
<li>Or all components‚Äô config:  <code>hass --script check_config --info all</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can get help from the command line using: <code>hass --script check_config --help</code></p>
<h3>Advanced Usage</h3>
<p>We offer four advanced options to include whole directories at once. Please note that your files must have the <code>.yaml</code> file extension; <code>.yml</code> is not supported.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>!include_dir_list</code> will return the content of a directory as a list with each file content being an entry in the list. The list entries are ordered based on the alphanumeric ordering of the names of the files.</li>
<li><code>!include_dir_named</code> will return the content of a directory as a dictionary which maps filename =&gt; content of file.</li>
<li><code>!include_dir_merge_list</code> will return the content of a directory as a list by merging all files (which should contain a list) into 1 big list.</li>
<li><code>!include_dir_merge_named</code> will return the content of a directory as a dictionary by loading each file and merging it into 1 big dictionary.</li>
</ul>
<p>These work recursively. As an example using <code>!include_dir_* automation</code>, will include all 6 files shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">.

<p>It is important to note that each file must contain only <strong>one</strong> entry when using <code>!include_dir_list</code>.
It is also important to note that if you are splitting a file after adding -id: to support the automation UI,
the -id: line must be removed from each of the split files.</p>
