I"Ü<h2>Automatic setup via Home Assistant Cloud</h2>
<p>With <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, you can connect your Home Assistant instance in a few simple clicks to Amazon Alexa. With Home Assistant Cloud, you donâ€™t have to deal with dynamic DNS, SSL certificates, or opening ports on your router. Just log in via the user interface and a secure connection with the cloud will be established. Home Assistant Cloud requires a paid subscription after a 30-day free trial.</p>
<p>For Home Assistant Cloud Users, documentation can be found <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/config/amazon_alexa/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Manual setup</h2>
<p>There are a few ways that you can use Amazon Alexa and Home Assistant together.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/alexa.intent/">Build custom commands</a></li>
<li><a href="/integrations/alexa.flash_briefings/">Create a new Flash Briefing source</a></li>
<li><a href="/integrations/alexa.smart_home/">Use the Smart Home API to control lights, etc.</a></li>
<li>Alternative: use the <a href="/integrations/emulated_hue/">Emulated Hue integration</a> to trick Alexa into thinking Home Assistant is a Philips Hue hub.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Manual setup of the integration with Amazon Alexa has several requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Developer Account. You can sign up <a href="https://developer.amazon.com">here</a>.</li>
<li>Building custom commands and Flash Briefing require your Home Assistant instance to be accessible from the Internet with HTTPS on port 443.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">AWS account</a> is needed if you want to use the Smart Home Skill API. A part of your Smart Home Skill will be hosted on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/">AWS Lambda</a>. However, you donâ€™t need to worry about costs; AWS Lambda is free for up to 1 million requests and 1GB of outbound data transfer per month.</li>
<li>Smart Home API also needs your Home Assistant instance to be accessible from the Internet.</li>
</ul>
