I"z<p>Enable parsing of the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header, passing on the clientâ€™s correct IP address in proxied setups. You <strong>must</strong> also whitelist trusted proxies using the <code>trusted_proxies</code> setting for this to work. Non-whitelisted requests with this header will be considered IP spoofing attacks, and the header will, therefore, be ignored.</p>
