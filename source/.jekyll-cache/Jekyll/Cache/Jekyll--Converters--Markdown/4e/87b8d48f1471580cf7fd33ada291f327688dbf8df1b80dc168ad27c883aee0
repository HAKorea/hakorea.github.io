I"p<p>This integration allows you to connect your <a href="https://esphome.io">ESPHome</a> devices directly to Home Assistant with the <a href="https://esphome.io/components/api.html">native ESPHome API</a>.</p>
<h2>Set up the integration via the integrations screen</h2>
<p>Menu: <em>Configuration</em> &gt; <em>Integrations</em></p>
<p>Press on <strong>ESPHome</strong> and configure the integration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the address and port of your node. For example, if the node is called <code>livingroom</code>, the address would be <code>livingroom.local</code> and the port number would be <code>6053</code> (default).</li>
</ul>
<p>Home Assistant will then try to connect to the device. If you have a password set, Home Assistant will also ask you for it. After that, all the entities you have configured on your ESPHome node will automatically appear in Home Assistant.</p>
