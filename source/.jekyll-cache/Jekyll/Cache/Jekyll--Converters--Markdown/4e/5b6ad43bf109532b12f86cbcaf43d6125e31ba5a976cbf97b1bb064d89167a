I"Ã<p><a href="http://www.lutron.com/">Lutron</a> is an American lighting control company. They have several lines of home automation devices that manage light switches, dimmers, occupancy sensors, HVAC controls, etc. The <code>lutron_caseta</code> integration in Home Assistant is responsible for communicating with the Lutron Caseta Smart Bridge for the <a href="https://www.casetawireless.com/">Caseta</a> product line of dimmers, switches and shades.</p>
<p>This integration only supports the <a href="https://www.casetawireless.com/">Caseta</a> line of products. Both Smart Bridge (L-BDG2-WH) and Smart Bridge PRO (L-BDGPRO2-WH) models are supported. For the RadioRA 2 product line, see the <a href="/integrations/lutron/">Lutron component</a>.</p>
<p>The currently supported Caseta devices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wall and plug-in dimmers as <a href="#light">lights</a></li>
<li>Wall switches as <a href="#switch">switches</a></li>
<li>Scenes as <a href="#scene">scenes</a></li>
<li>Lutron shades as <a href="#cover">covers</a></li>
<li>Lutron smart <a href="#fan">fan</a> speed control</li>
</ul>
<p>When configured, the <code>lutron_caseta</code> integration will automatically discover the currently supported devices as setup in the Lutron Smart Bridge. The name assigned in the Lutron mobile app will be used to form the <code>entity_id</code> used in Home Assistant. e.g., a dimmer called â€˜Lampâ€™ in a room called â€˜Bedroomâ€™ becomes <code>light.bedroom_lamp</code> in Home Assistant.</p>
<p>To use Lutron Caseta devices in your installation, you must first log in to your Lutron account and generate a certificate that allows Home Assistant to connect to your bridge. This can be accomplished by downloading and executing <a href="https://github.com/gurumitts/pylutron-caseta/blob/master/get_lutron_cert.py">get_lutron_cert.py</a>, which will generate three files: caseta.key, caseta.crt, caseta-bridge.crt when you run it. See the instructions at the top of the script for more information.</p>
<p>Once you have the three necessary files, place them in your configuration directory and add the following to your <code>configuration.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
lutron_caseta:
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    keyfile: caseta.key
    certfile: caseta.crt
    ca_certs: caseta-bridge.crt
</code></pre>

<div class='note'>
<p>It is recommended to assign a static IP address to your Lutron Smart Bridge. This ensures that it wonâ€™t change IP address, so you wonâ€™t have to change the <code>host</code> if it reboots and comes up with a different IP address.
<br>
Use a DHCP reservation on your router to reserve the address or in the PRO model of the Smart Bridge, set the IP address under Network Settings in the Advanced / Integration menu in the mobile app.</p>

<p>To get Lutron Caseta roller, honeycomb shades, lights, scene and switch working with Home Assistant. First follow the instructions for the general Lutron Caseta integration above.</p>
<h2>Cover</h2>
<p>After setup, shades will appear in Home Assistant using an <code>entity_id</code> based on the name used in the Lutron mobile app. For example, a shade called â€˜Living Room Windowâ€™ will appear in Home Assistant as <code>cover.living_room_window</code>.</p>
<p>For more information on working with shades in Home Assistant, see the <a href="/integrations/cover/">Covers component</a>.</p>
<p>Available services: <code>cover.open_cover</code>, <code>cover.close_cover</code> and <code>cover.set_cover_position</code>. Cover <code>position</code> ranges from <code>0</code> for fully closed to <code>100</code> for fully open.</p>
<h2>Light</h2>
<p>After setup, dimmable lights including wall and plug-in dimmers will appear in Home Assistant using an <code>entity_id</code> based on the name used in the Lutron mobile app. For example, a light called â€˜Bedroom Lampâ€™ will appear in Home Assistant as <code>light.bedroom_lamp</code>.</p>
<p>For non-dimmable lights or switched loads, see the switch section on this page.</p>
<p>For more information on working with lights in Home Assistant, see the <a href="/integrations/light/">Lights component</a>.</p>
