I"N <p>The <code>sonos</code> integration allows you to control your <a href="https://www.sonos.com">Sonos</a> wireless speakers from Home Assistant. It also works with IKEA Symfonisk speakers.</p>
<p>You can configure the Sonos integration by going to the integrations page inside the config panel.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Sonos integration makes various custom services available.</p>
<h3>Service <code>sonos.snapshot</code></h3>
<p>Take a snapshot of what is currently playing on one or more speakers. This service, and the following one, are useful if you want to play a doorbell or notification sound and resume playback afterwards. If no <code>entity_id</code> is provided, all speakers are snapshotted.</p>
<div class='note'>
<p>The queue is not snapshotted and must be left untouched until the restore. Using <code>media_player.play_media</code> is safe and can be used to play a notification sound, including <a href="/integrations/tts/">TTS</a> announcements.</p>

A cloud queue cannot be restarted. This includes queues started from within Spotify and queues controlled by Amazon Alexa.

<h2>Advanced use</h2>
<p>For advanced uses, there are some manual configuration options available. These are usually only needed if you have a complex network setup where Home Assistant and Sonos are not on the same subnet.</p>
<p>You can disable auto-discovery by specifying the Sonos IP addresses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry with manually specified Sonos IP addresses
sonos:
  media_player:
    hosts:
      - 192.0.2.25
      - 192.0.2.26
      - 192.0.2.27
</code></pre>
<p>If your Home Assistant server has multiple IP addresses, you can provide the IP address that should be used for Sonos auto-discovery. This is rarely needed since all addresses should be tried by default.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry using Sonos discovery on a specific interface
sonos:
  media_player:
    interface_addr: 192.0.2.1
</code></pre>
<p>The Sonos speakers will attempt to connect back to Home Assistant to deliver change events (using TCP port 1400). You can change the IP address that Home Assistant advertises to Sonos speakers. This can help in NAT scenarios such as when <em>not</em> using the Docker option <code>--net=host</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry modifying the advertised host address
sonos:
  media_player:
    advertise_addr: 192.0.2.1
</code></pre>
