I"@<p><a href="https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED">WLED</a> is a fast and feature-rich
implementation of an ESP8266/ESP32 webserver to control
NeoPixel (WS2812B, WS2811, SK6812, APA102, and similar) LED’s.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>This integration can be configured using the integrations in the
Home Assistant frontend.</p>
<p>Menu: <strong>Configuration</strong> -&gt; <strong>Integrations</strong>.</p>
<p>In most cases, the WLED devices will be automatically discovered by
Home Assistant. Those automatically discovered WLED devices are listed
on the integrations page.</p>
<p>If for some reason (e.g., due to lack of mDNS support on your network),
the WLED device isn’t discovered, it can be added manually.</p>
<p>Click on the <code>+</code> sign to add an integration and click on <strong>WLED</strong>.
After completing the configuration flow, the WLED
integration will be available.</p>
<h2>Lights</h2>
<p>This integration adds the WLED device as a light in Home Assistant.
Home Assistant treats every segment of the LED strip as a separate light
entity.</p>
<p>Only native supported features of a light in Home Assistant are supported
(which includes effects).</p>
<h2>Sensors</h2>
<p>This integration provides sensors for the following information from WLED:</p>
<ul>
<li>Estimated current.</li>
<li>Uptime.</li>
<li>Free memory.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Switches</h2>
<p>The integration will create a number of switches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nightlight.</li>
<li>Sync Receive.</li>
<li>Sync Send.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>This integration currently does not offer any additional services.</p>
