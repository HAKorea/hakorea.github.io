I"ù<p>You can specify a name of the component, but do not have to. If you specify a name, the weather integration will get an entity name of <code>weather.[name]</code>; if no name is specified, it will try to set its name to <code>weather.BR_[stationname]</code>. However at the moment in time, the entity is created, no data has been retrieved yet, so the entity will get named <code>weather.BR_unknown_station</code>. Later the station name will be known and get updated, but the entity name remains.</p>
