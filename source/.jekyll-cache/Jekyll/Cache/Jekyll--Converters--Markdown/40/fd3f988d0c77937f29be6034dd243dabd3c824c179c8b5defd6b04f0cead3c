<h3>First Home Assistant release with the issue</h3>
<p>Please provide the release which contains the issue.</p>
<h3>Last working Home Assistant release (if known)</h3>
<p>If possible, provide the latest release of which you know that the integration or platform was working. Home Assistant is evolving very fast and issues may already be addressed or be introduced by a recent change.</p>
<h3>Operating environment (Hass.io/Docker/Windows/etc.)</h3>
<p>There are many different ways to run Home Assistant. In this section please mention which you are using, e.g., manual installation, <a href="/hassio/">Hass.io</a>, Hasbian or as container (Docker). It can help if you mention which operating system you are using because not all are supported on the same level.</p>
<h3>Integration/platform</h3>
<p>Please add the link to the documention of the integration/platform in question. E.g.,</p>
<ul>
<li>issue with the <code>random</code> sensor: <a href="/integrations/random#sensor">/integrations/random#sensor</a></li>
<li>issue with the <code>hue</code> integration: <a href="/integrations/hue/">/integrations/hue/</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Description of problem</h3>
<p>Provide a summary of your issue and tell us what‚Äôs wrong.</p>
<p>There are integrations and platform which require additional steps (installing third-party tools, compilers, etc.) to get your setup working. Please describe the steps you took and the ones to reproduce the issue if needed.</p>
<h3>Problem-relevant <code>configuration.yaml</code> entries</h3>
<p>To exclude configuration issues and allow the developers to quickly test, and perhaps reproduce, your issue, add the relevant part of your <code>configuration.yaml</code> file. This file is located in your <a href="/docs/configuration/">configuration folder</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">sensor:
  - platform: random
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that you don‚Äôt post your username, password, API key, access token or other <a href="/docs/configuration/secrets/">secrets</a>.</p>
<h3>Traceback (if applicable)</h3>
<p>If things go wrong there will be a so-called traceback or an error message in other words in your log. Please include this. It starts with <strong>Traceback</strong> and can contain informations where the error was triggered in the code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Traceback (most recent call last):
...
</code></pre>
