I"<p>This utility should have been installed as part of the Python 3 installation. Check if Python 3 is installed by running <code>python3 --version</code>. If it is not installed, <a href="https://www.python.org/getit/">download it here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are able to successfully run <code>python3 --version</code> but not <code>pip3</code>, install Home Assistant by running the following command instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ python3 -m pip install homeassistant
</code></pre>
<p>On a Debian system, you can also install python3 by <code>sudo apt-get install python3</code> and pip3 by <code>sudo apt-get install python3-pip</code>.</p>
<p>If you run into errors during installation, check that youâ€™ve installed all the necessary prerequisite packages, which include <code>python3-dev</code>, <code>libffi-dev</code>, and <code>libssl-dev</code>. On a Debian-based system, you can install these via <code>apt-get</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
</code></pre>
