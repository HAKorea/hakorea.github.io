I"£<p>This offers a map on the frontend to display the location of tracked devices. To set up tracked devices, look at the <a href="/integrations/device_tracker/">device tracker</a> documentation. This integration is by default enabled, unless youâ€™ve disabled or removed the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/default_config/"><code>default_config:</code></a> line from your configuration. If that is the case, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Example configuration.yaml entry
map:
</code></pre>
<div class='note'>
Devices that are currently at home won't show on the map.
</div>
