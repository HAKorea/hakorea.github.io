I"•<p>AlarmDecoder has no way to tell us which zones are actually in use, so each zone must be configured in Home Assistant. For each zone, at least a name must be given. For more information on the available zone types, take a look at the <a href="/integrations/alarmdecoder">Binary Sensor</a> docs. <em>Note: If no zones are specified, Home Assistant will not load any binary_sensor integrations.</em></p>
