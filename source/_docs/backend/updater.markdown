Starting with 0.31 the [updater component](/integrations/updater/) sends an optional report about Home Assistant instance.

If you want to opt-in to include integration information, add `include_used_components` to your config. This will allow the Home Assistant developers to focus development efforts on the most popular components.

```yaml
updater:
  include_used_components: true
```

We are only collecting this information to better understand our user base to provide better long term support and feature development.

In addition to the above collected data, the server will also use your IP address to do a geographic IP address lookup to determine a general geographic area that your address is located in. To be extremely, extremely clear about this bit: __The Home Assistant updater does not: store your IP address in a database and also does not submit the location information from your `configuration.yaml`.__

Our tests showed that at best, we get 4 digits of accuracy on your IP address location which is a 5 mile radius of your actual IP location, assuming that it is even correct in the first place (geo IP lookups are very hit or miss).

The server also adds two timestamps to the data:

- the original date your instance UUID was first seen
- the timestamp of the last time we have seen your instance

We will never publicly expose individual gathered data. We might however publish aggregated stats about our user base (example: 70% of all users use Linux). We will never sell or allow the use of this information for non-Home Assistant development purposes.
