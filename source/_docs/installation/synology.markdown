<div class='note warning'>

Synology only provide Python 3.5.1, which is not compatible with Home Assistant 0.65.0 or later. Until Synology offer an updated version of Python, Home Assistant 0.64 is the most recent version that will be able to be installed. You can manually specify the version of Home Assistant to install, for example to install version 0.64.3 you would do `./python3 -m pip install homeassistant==0.64.3`

There are 2 alternatives, when using Home Assistant on Synology NAS:
1. using Docker
2. directly running on DSM

Option 1 is described on the [Docker installation page](/docs/installation/docker/), whereas Option 2 is described below.


The following configuration has been tested on Synology 413j running DSM 6.0-7321 Update 1.

Running these commands will:

 - Install Home Assistant
 - Enable Home Assistant to be launched on `http://localhost:8123`

Using the Synology webadmin:

 - Install python3 using the Synology Package Center
 - Create homeassistant user and add to the "users" group

SSH onto your synology & login as admin or root

 - Log in with your own administrator account
 - Switch to root using:

```bash
$ sudo -i
```


Check the path to python3 (assumed to be /volume1/@appstore/py3k/usr/local/bin)

```bash
# cd /volume1/@appstore/py3k/usr/local/bin
```

Install PIP (Python's package management system)

```bash
# ./python3 -m ensurepip
```

Use PIP to install Homeassistant package 0.64.3

```bash
# ./python3 -m pip install homeassistant==0.64.3
```

Create homeassistant config directory & switch to it

```bash
# mkdir /volume1/homeassistant
# chown homeassistant /volume1/homeassistant 
# chmod 755 /volume1/homeassistant
# cd /volume1/homeassistant
```
Hint: alternatively you can also create a "Shared Folder" via Synology WebUI (e.g., via "File Station") - this has the advantage that the folder is visible via "File Station".

Create hass-daemon file using the following code (edit the variables in uppercase if necessary)

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Package
PACKAGE="homeassistant"
DNAME="Home Assistant"

# Others
USER="homeassistant"
PYTHON_DIR="/volume1/@appstore/py3k/usr/local/bin"
PYTHON="$PYTHON_DIR/python3"
HASS="$PYTHON_DIR/hass"
INSTALL_DIR="/volume1/homeassistant"
PID_FILE="$INSTALL_DIR/home-assistant.pid"
FLAGS="-v --config $INSTALL_DIR --pid-file $PID_FILE --daemon"
REDIRECT="> $INSTALL_DIR/home-assistant.log 2>&1"

start_daemon ()
{
    sudo -u ${USER} /bin/sh -c "$PYTHON $HASS $FLAGS $REDIRECT;"
}

stop_daemon ()
{
    kill `cat ${PID_FILE}`
    wait_for_status 1 20 || kill -9 `cat ${PID_FILE}`
    rm -f ${PID_FILE}
}

daemon_status ()
{
    if [ -f ${PID_FILE} ] && kill -0 `cat ${PID_FILE}` > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        return
    fi
    rm -f ${PID_FILE}
    return 1
}

wait_for_status ()
{
    counter=$2
    while [ ${counter} -gt 0 ]; do
        daemon_status
        [ $? -eq $1 ] && return
        let counter=counter-1
        sleep 1
    done
    return 1
}

case $1 in
    start)
        if daemon_status; then
            echo ${DNAME} is already running
            exit 0
        else
            echo Starting ${DNAME} ...
            start_daemon
            exit $?
        fi
        ;;
    stop)
        if daemon_status; then
            echo Stopping ${DNAME} ...
            stop_daemon
            exit $?
        else
            echo ${DNAME} is not running
            exit 0
        fi
        ;;
        restart)
        if daemon_status; then
            echo Stopping ${DNAME} ...
            stop_daemon
            echo Starting ${DNAME} ...
            start_daemon
            exit $?
        else
            echo ${DNAME} is not running
            echo Starting ${DNAME} ...
            start_daemon
            exit $?
        fi
        ;;
    status)
        if daemon_status; then
            echo ${DNAME} is running
            exit 0
        else
            echo ${DNAME} is not running
            exit 1
        fi
        ;;
    log)
        echo ${LOG_FILE}
        exit 0
        ;;
    *)
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

```

Create links to python folders to make things easier in the future:

```bash
# ln -s /volume1/@appstore/py3k/usr/local/bin/python3 python3
# ln -s /volume1/@appstore/py3k/usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/homeassistant homeassistant
```

Set the owner and permissions on your config folder

```bash
# chown -R homeassistant:users /volume1/homeassistant
# chmod -R 664 /volume1/homeassistant
```

Make the daemon file executable:

```bash
# chmod 755 /volume1/homeassistant/hass-daemon
```

Update your firewall (if it is turned on the Synology device):

 - Go to your Synology control panel
 - Go to security 
 - Go to firewall
 - Go to Edit Rules
 - Click Create
 - Select Custom: Destination port "TCP"
 - Type "8123" in port
 - Click on OK
 - Click on OK again


Copy your configuration.yaml file into the config folder
That's it... you're all set to go

Here are some useful commands:

- Start Home Assistant:

```bash
$ sudo /volume1/homeassistant/hass-daemon start
```

- Stop Home Assistant:

```bash
$ sudo /volume1/homeassistant/hass-daemon stop
```

- Restart Home Assistant:

```bash
$ sudo /volume1/homeassistant/hass-daemon restart
```

- Upgrade Home Assistant::

```bash
$  /volume1/@appstore/py3k/usr/local/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade homeassistant
```
