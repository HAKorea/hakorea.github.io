[armbian](https://www.armbian.com) runs on a wide-variety of [ARM development boards](https://www.armbian.com/download/). Currently there are around 50 boards supported inclusive the OrangePi family, Cubieboard, Pine64, and Odroid.

Setup Python and `pip`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip
```

Now that you installed python, there are two ways to install Home Assistant:
1. It is recommended to install Home Assistant in a virtual environment to avoid using `root`, using the [VirtualEnv instructions](/docs/installation/virtualenv/)
2. Alternatively, you can install Home Assistant for the user you created when first booting Armbian:

```bash
sudo pip3 install homeassistant
hass --open-ui
```

Running these commands will:

 - Install Home Assistant
 - Launch Home Assistant and serve the web interface on `http://localhost:8123`
 - the configuration files will be created in /home/{user}/.homeassistant
