If you're running a Linux-based platform, we strongly recommend you follow the instructions for a [virtual environment](/docs/installation/virtualenv/) instead.

Once Python is installed, execute the following code in a console:

```bash
pip3 install homeassistant
hass --open-ui
```

Running these commands will:

 - Install Home Assistant
 - Launch Home Assistant and serve the web interface on [http://localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123)

Video tutorials of this process for various operating systems are available here:
