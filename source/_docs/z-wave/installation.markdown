### Network Key

Security Z-Wave devices require a network key before being added to the network using the Add Secure Node button in the Z-Wave Network Management card. You must set the *network_key* configuration variable to use a network key before adding these devices.

An easy script to generate a random key:
```bash
$ cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '0-9A-F' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1 | sed -e 's/\(..\)/0x\1, /g' -e 's/, $//'
```

You can also use sites like [this one](https://www.random.org/cgi-bin/randbyte?nbytes=16&format=h) to generate the required data, just remember to put `0x` before each pair of characters:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for network_key
zwave:
  network_key: "0x2e, 0xcc, 0xab, 0x1c, 0xa3, 0x7f, 0x0e, 0xb5, 0x70, 0x71, 0x2d, 0x98, 0x25, 0x43, 0xee, 0x0c"
```

Ensure you keep a backup of this key. If you have to rebuild your system and don't have a backup of this key, you won't be able to reconnect to any security devices. This may mean you have to do a factory reset on those devices, and your controller, before rebuilding your Z-Wave network.

## First Run

On platforms other than Hass.io and Docker, the compilation and installation of python-openzwave happens when you first enable the Z-Wave component, and can take half an hour or more on a Raspberry Pi. When you upgrade Home Assistant and python-openzwave is also upgraded, this will also result in a delay while the new version is compiled and installed.

The first run after adding a device is when the `zwave` integration will take time to initialize the entities, some entities may appear with incomplete names. Running a network heal may speed up this process.

## Platform specific instructions

### Hass.io

You do not need to install any software to use Z-Wave.

If the path of `/dev/ttyACM0` doesn't work, look in the *System* section of the *Hass.io* menu. There you'll find a *Hardware* button which will list all the hardware found.

You can also check what hardware has been found using the [hassio command](/hassio/commandline/#hardware):

```bash
$ hassio hardware info
```

If you did an alternative install of Hass.io on Linux (e.g. installing Ubuntu, then Docker, then Hass.io) then the `modemmanager` package will interfere with any Z-Wave (or Zigbee) stick and should be removed or disabled in the host OS. Failure to do so will result in random failures of those components, e.g. dead or unreachable Z-Wave nodes, most notably right after Home Assistant restarts. Connect to your host OS via SSH, then you can disable with `sudo systemctl disable ModemManager` and remove with `sudo apt-get purge modemmanager` (commands are for Debian/Ubuntu).

### Docker

You do not need to install any software to use Z-Wave.

To enable access to the Z-Wave stick, add `--device=/dev/ttyACM0` to the `docker` command that starts your container, for example:

```bash
$ docker run -d --name="home-assistant" -v /home/pi/homeassistant:/config -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro --net=host --device=/dev/ttyACM0 homeassistant/raspberrypi3-homeassistant
```

If the path of `/dev/ttyACM0` doesn't work then you can find the path of the stick by disconnecting and then reconnecting it, and running the following in the Docker host:

```bash
ls -1tr /dev/tty*|tail -n 1
```

The `modemmanager` package will interfere with any Z-Wave (or Zigbee) stick and should be removed or disabled. Failure to do so will result in random failures of those components. For example you can disable with `sudo systemctl disable ModemManager` and remove with `sudo apt-get purge modemmanager`

### Community install methods

#### Raspberry Pi specific

On the Raspberry Pi you will need to enable the serial interface in the `raspi-config` tool before you can add Z-Wave to Home Assistant. Make sure to reboot the Raspberry Pi for the setting to take effect.

#### Linux

On Debian Linux platforms there are dependencies you will need to have installed ahead of time (included in `systemd-devel` on Fedora/RHEL systems):

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libudev-dev build-essential
```

You may also have to install the Python development libraries for your version of Python. For example `libpython3.6-dev`, and possibly `python3.6-dev` if you're using Python 3.6.

##### Finding the controller path

To find the path of your Z-Wave USB stick, disconnect it and then reconnect it to your system and run:

```bash
ls -ltr /dev/tty*|tail -n 1
```

That will give you a line that looks something like this:

```bash
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 204, 64 Sep 21 10:25 /dev/ttyACM0
```

Where the date and time displayed is approximately the time you connected the USB stick or module (it may also be something like `/dev/ttyAMA0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0`). The number will be zero for the first device connected, and higher numbers for later devices.

Or, if there is no result, try to find detailed USB connection info with:

```bash
dmesg | grep USB
```

If Home Assistant (`hass`) runs with another user (e.g., *homeassistant*) you need to give access to the stick with:

```bash
$ sudo usermod -aG dialout homeassistant
```

The output from `ls -ltr` above contains the following information:
* The device type is `c` (character special)
* The permissions are `rw-rw----`, meaning only the owner and group can read and write to it
* There is only `1` link to the file
* It is owned by `root` and can be accessed by members of the group `dialout`
* It has a major device number of `204`, and a minor device number of `64`
* The device was connected at `10:25` on `21 September`
* The device is `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

#### macOS

When installing on macOS you may have to also run the command below ahead of time, replace "x.x" with the version of Python (`$ python3 --version`) you have installed.

```bash
sudo /Applications/Python\ x.x/Install\ Certificates.command
```

On macOS you can find the USB stick with:

```bash
ls /dev/cu.usbmodem*
```

## Troubleshooting

### Device path changes

If your device path changes when you restart, see [this guide](http://hintshop.ludvig.co.nz/show/persistent-names-usb-serial-devices/) on fixing it.

### Random unreachable Z-Wave nodes: ModemManager interference

If this applies to your situation:
- Some or all Z-Wave nodes are unreachable after restarting Home Assistant; not necessarily after every restart but seemingly random.
- The Z-Wave stick stops responding, needs to be re-plugged or Home Assistant needs a restart to get Z-Wave back.
- Your host OS is Debian-based/Ubuntu (for example: you installed Ubuntu, then Docker, then Hass.io).

Then chances are high that the ModemManager in the host OS is causing the issue, claiming or interfering with the USB Z-Wave stick like the much used Aeotec ones. In this case you need to disable ModemManager.

Connect to your host OS (e.g. Ubuntu) through SSH, then execute the following command on your host system to disable the ModemManager:

 ```bash
systemctl disable ModemManager.service
```

### Component could not be set up

Sometimes the device may not be accessible and you'll get an error message upon startup about not being able to set up Z-Wave. Run the following command for your device path (here we're using `/dev/ttyAMA0` for our Razberry board):

```bash
ls -l /dev/ttyAMA0
```

You should then see something like this:

```txt
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 204, 64 Apr  1 12:34 /dev/ttyAMA0
```

The important pieces are the first piece `crw-rw----` and the group `dialout`. If those are different then, for your device path, run:

```bash
sudo chgrp dialout /dev/ttyAMA0
sudo chmod g+rw /dev/ttyAMA0
```

Check too that the account you're running Home Assistant as is in the `dialout` group. For instance, if you're using `homeassistant`:

```bash
groups homeassistant
```

That should include `dialout`, if it doesn't then:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout homeassistant
```

### Unable to install Python Openzwave

If you're getting errors like:

    openzwave-embed/open-zwave-master/libopenzwave.a: No such file or directory

Then the problem is that you're missing `libudev-dev` (or the equivalent for your distribution), please [install it](/docs/z-wave/installation/#linux).

### Random failures

If you're having random failures of the mesh, devices going missing, things randomly not working, check your `OZW_Log.txt` for the following messages:

```txt
WARNING: 500ms passed without reading the rest of the frame...aborting frame read
WARNING: Out of frame flow! (0xfe).  Sending NAK
WARNING: Checksum incorrect - sending NAK
```

If you see any of these messages repeated in the log then _probably_ you've got something else running that's also using the Z-Wave controller. That might mean you've also got the OpenZ-Wave control panel (ozwcp) running, a second instance of Home Assistant or something else. You need to stop that other process to resolve this.
