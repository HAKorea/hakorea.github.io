title: "Z-Wave Query Stage"
description: "What are the Query Stages."
---

When the Z-Wave mesh is first started, the controller will go through all the following stages for every device on the mesh. This is a slow process, and to complete requires that the devices be awake. While devices that are mains or USB powered are always awake, battery-powered devices spend most of their time asleep. Because of this, you can expect that after startup your battery powered devices will spend time in `Initializing (CacheLoad)` - how long depends on the device.

Your devices will still function normally while marked as `Initializing`.
