<div class='note'>

This is a work in progress, based upon reports in the forum, the author's own devices and reading of various documentation. It will be incomplete, so if you have a device that isn't reported here or have a device that reports a different value, please provide a report in the [Z-Wave section](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/configuration/zwave) of the forum or the #zwave channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RkajcgS).

## Binary Sensor

Devices that support the Binary Sensor command class will create one (or more) entities starting with `binary_sensor`. For example, if the node is `door_sensor` then the binary sensor entity will be `binary_sensor.door_sensor`.

These will normally be `on` when the sensor is active, otherwise they will be `off`. Some devices use `on` for closed, and some use `on` for open, and some devices allow you to change how they report.

## Alarm

This is for a single purpose sensor, multi sensors are explained under Multi Sensor.

Devices (usually sensors) that support the Alarm command class will create entities starting with `sensor`, and with some generic suffixes, and a suffix that relates to the supported alarm class. For example, the smoke detector `lounge` will have an entity `sensor.lounge_smoke`, and possibly also `sensor.lounge_alarm_type` and `sensor.lounge_alarm_level`. If the device creates a `binary_sensor` entity, it is recommended to use that rather then the `sensor` entity.

Note that the older Z-Wave alarm command class version 1 didn't have standardized types, and so each manufacturer specified their own version and type info. With Version 2 the alarm type was standardized to the below list. See the [openzwave alarm command class documents](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/wiki/Alarm-Command-Class) for more info. You can see which version your sensor supports via the zwcfg_0x\*.xml file. An example with version 2 support:
```xml
<CommandClass id="113" name="COMMAND_CLASS_ALARM" version="2" request_flags="2" innif="true">
```

### Alarm Level Entity

The meaning of the `alarm_level` entity depends on the nature of the alarm sensor.

### Access Control Entity

- **access_control**: These *may* vary between brands
  - **22**: Open
  - **23**: Closed
  - **254**: Deep sleep
  - **255**: Case open

If your device has an `access_control` entity, but not a `binary_sensor` equivalent, you can use a [template binary sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor.template/) to create one (here we've defined it as a door, but you can use [any relevant device class](/integrations/binary_sensor/#device-class):

{% raw %}
```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors: 
      YOUR_SENSOR:
        friendly_name: "Friendly name here"
        device_class: door
        value_template: "{{ is_state('sensor.YOUR_ORIGINAL_SENSOR_access_control', '22') }}"
```
{% endraw %}

### Burglar Entity

- **burglar**: These *may* vary between brands
   - **0**: Not active
   - **2**: Smoke (?)
   - **3**: Tamper
   - **8**: Motion
   - **22**: Open
   - **23**: Closed
   - **254**: Deep sleep
   - **255**: Case open

If your device has a `burglar` entity, but not a `binary_sensor` equivalent, you can use a [template binary sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor.template/) to create one (here we've defined it as a motion sensor, but you can use [any relevant device class](/integrations/binary_sensor/#device-class):

{% raw %}
```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors: 
      YOUR_SENSOR:
        friendly_name: "Friendly name here"
        device_class: motion
        value_template: "{{ is_state('sensor.YOUR_SENSOR_burglar', '8') }}"
```
{% endraw %}

### Source Node ID Entity

- **sourcenodeid**: Reports the sensor that generated the alarm - this is only valid for Zensor Net based devices

## Multisensor

Multi sensor devices will create a number of entities, one for each sensor, potentially a `binary_sensor` entity, and probably also `alarm_type` and `alarm_level` entities.

These are all generally self explanatory, however it's worth noting:

- **ultraviolet** sensors will usually report zero indoors, as UVB is blocked by glass
- **luminance** sensors should report in [Lux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux)
