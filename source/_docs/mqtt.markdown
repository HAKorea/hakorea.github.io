MQTT (aka MQ Telemetry Transport) is a machine-to-machine or "Internet of Things" connectivity protocol on top of TCP/IP. It allows extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.

To integrate MQTT into Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  broker: IP_ADDRESS
```

For detailed setup instructions, please refer to the [MQTT broker](/docs/mqtt/broker) documentation.
