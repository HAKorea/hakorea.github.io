Using HAProxy to proxy for Home Assistant allows you to serve Home Assistant securely over standard ports with HTTP to HTTPS redirection.

### Install HAProxy on your server

This will vary depending on your OS. Check out Google for this.

### Obtain an SSL certificate

There are multiple ways of obtaining an SSL certificate. Letâ€™s Encrypt is one method.
Use Google for this, but a good example of using Certbot can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-haproxy-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-14-04).

### HAPRoxy Configuration

The following configuration updates HAProxy defaults for more secure ciphers for SSL and logging and connection
timeouts.

Items to update for your deployment:

 * `bind`: Update the ports HAProxy listens on for forwarding.
 * `subdomain.domain.com`: Your domain to use
 * `ssl crt`: The path to your SSL certificate.
 * `server hass 127.0.0.1:8123`: The IP and port location of your Home Assistant instance.

```

### Forward Ports

Forward ports 443 and (optionally) 80 to your server on your router.

Do not forward port 8123, HAProxy takes care of securing the connection with HTTPS on 443.
If 8123 is forwarded then it will not be secured.

Replace 443 with whatever port you chose to bind to in the config if different.

### Configure Home Assistant HTTP Component

In your `configuration.yaml` file, edit the [http component](/integrations/http/).

```text
http:
  # For extra security set this to only accept connection on localhost if HAProxy is on the same machine
  # server_host: 127.0.0.1
  # Update this line to be your domain
  base_url: https://example.com
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  # You must set the trusted proxy IP address so that Home Assistant will properly accept connections
  # Set this to your HAProxy machine IP, or localhost if hosted on the same machine.
  trusted_proxies: <HAProxy IP address here, 127.0.0.1 if same machine>
```

### Restart or Reload HAProxy

Use your OS method of restarting or reloading HAProxy. Use Google for this.
