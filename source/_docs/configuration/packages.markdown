Packages in Home Assistant provide a way to bundle different component's configuration together. We already learned about the two configuration styles (specifying platforms entries together or individually) on the [adding devices](/docs/configuration/devices/) page. Both of these configuration methods require you to create the integration key in the main `configuration.yaml` file. With packages we have a way to include different components, or different configuration parts using any of the `!include` directives introduced in [splitting the configuration](/docs/configuration/splitting_configuration).

Packages are configured under the core `homeassistant/packages` in the configuration and take the format of a package name (no spaces, all lower case) followed by a dictionary with the package config. For example, package `pack_1` would be created as:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  ...
  packages: 
    pack_1:
      ...package configuration here...
```

The package configuration can include: `switch`, `light`, `automation`, `groups`, or most other Home Assistant integrations including hardware platforms.

It can be specified inline or in a separate YAML file using `!include`.

Inline example, main `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  ...
  packages: 
    pack_1:
      switch:
        - platform: rest
          ...
      light:
        - platform: rpi
          ...
```

Include example, main `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  ...
  packages: 
    pack_1: !include my_package.yaml
```

The file `my_package.yaml` contains the "top-level" configuration:

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: rest
    ...
light:
  - platform: rpi
    ...
```

There are some rules for packages that will be merged:

1. Platform based integrations (`light`, `switch`, etc) can always be merged.
2. Components where entities are identified by a key that will represent the entity_id (`{key: config}`) need to have unique 'keys' between packages and the main configuration file. 

    For example if we have the following in the main config. You are not allowed to re-use "my_input" again for `input_boolean` in a package:
    
    ```yaml
    input_boolean:
      my_input:
    ```
3. Any integration that is not a platform [2], or dictionaries with Entity ID keys [3] can only be merged if its keys, except those for lists, are solely defined once.

Components inside packages can only specify platform entries using configuration style 1, where all the platforms are grouped under the integration name.

### Create a packages folder

One way to organize packages is to create a folder named "packages" in your Home Assistant configuration directory. In the packages directory you can store any number of packages in a YAML file. This entry in your `configuration.yaml` will load all packages:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages: !include_dir_named packages
```

This uses the concept splitting the configuration and will include all files in a directory with the keys representing the filenames.
See the documentation about [splitting the configuration](/docs/configuration/splitting_configuration/) for more information about `!include_dir_named` and other include statements that might be helpful. The benefit of this approach is to pull all configurations required to integrate a system, into one file, rather than across several.

### Customizing entities with packages

It is possible to [customize entities](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/) within packages. Just create your customization entries under:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  customize:
```
