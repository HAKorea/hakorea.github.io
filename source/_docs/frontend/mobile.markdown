Home Assistant has [a companion app for both Android and iOS](/docs/ecosystem/ios/).

As an alternative to the iOS and Android companion apps, you can add the Home Assistant "web app" to your homescreen as if it was native (Home Assistant leverages the W3C [manifest.json](https://w3c.github.io/manifest/) support).

### Android

  1. Open Chrome
  2. Navigate to your Home Assistant instance
  3. Tap on the Menu icon (three vertical bars)
  4. Tap on Add to Homescreen
  5. A dialog will popup; tap on Add
