The `cpuspeed` sensor platform to allow you to monitor the current CPU speed.

<div class='note warning'>

  You can't use this sensor in a Container (like Hass.io) as it requires access to the physical CPU. Also, not all [ARM CPUs](https://github.com/workhorsy/py-cpuinfo/#cpu-support) are supported.

</div>

## Configuration

To add this platform to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: cpuspeed
```

{% configuration %}
name:

  required: false
  type: string
  default: CPU speed
{% endconfiguration %}
