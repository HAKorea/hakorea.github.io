The `konnected` integration lets you connect wired sensors and switches to a NodeMCU ESP8226 based device running the [open source Konnected software](https://github.com/konnected-io/konnected-security). Reuse the wired sensors and siren from an old or pre-wired alarm system installation and integrate them directly into Home Assistant.

Visit the [Konnected.io website](https://konnected.io) for more information about the Konnected Alarm Panel board and compatible hardware.

The integration currently supports the following device types in Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor: Wired door and window sensors, motion detectors, glass-break detectors, leak sensors, smoke & CO detectors or any open/close switch.
- Switch: Actuate a siren, strobe, buzzer or relay module.
- Sensor: Periodic measurements from DHT temperature/humidity sensors and DS18B20 temperature sensors.

This integration uses the [`discovery`](/integrations/discovery) component, which must be enabled for device discovery to work. If you don't want to use discovery, set the _host_ and _port_ for each device in the description.  

<div class='note info'>

Konnected devices communicate with Home Assistant over your local LAN -- there is no cloud component! For best performance we recommend allowing unsecured HTTP API traffic between Konnected devices and Home Assistant on your LAN. This means that you should not use the `http` integration to serve SSL/TLS certificates. Instead, use a proxy like Nginx or Caddy to serve SSL/TLS.

### Configuration

A `konnected` section must be present in the `configuration.yaml` file that specifies the Konnected devices on the network and the sensors or actuators attached to them:

#### Configuration Notes

- Either **pin** or **zone** is required for each actuator or sensor. Do not use both in the same definition.
- Pin `D8` or the `out` zone will only work when activation is set to high (the default).

### Unique IDs and the Entity Registry

Beginning in Home Assistant release 0.90, unique IDs are generated for each sensor or switch entity. This enables end users to modify the entity names and entity IDs through the Home Assistant UI on the _Entity Registry_ page (under _Configuration_).

Unique IDs are internally generated as follows:

**Binary Sensors**: `{mac-address}-{zone-number}`

**Switches**: `{mac-address}-{unique-hash}`*

**DHT Sensors**: `{mac-address}-{pin-number}-{temperature|humidity}`

**DS18B20 Sensors**: `{sensor-serial-number}`

\* Switches are identified by a unique hash including the pin number, `momentary`, `pause`, and `repeat` values. If these values are modified, a new entity will be created and the old entity must be removed manually from the _Entity Registry_.  

### Pin Mapping

Konnected runs on an ESP8266 board with the NodeMCU firmware. It is commonly used with the NodeMCU dev kit WiFi module and optionally Konnected's Alarm Panel hardware. The following table shows the pin mapping between the Konnected hardware labeled zones, the NodeMCU labeled pins and the ESP8266 GPIO pins.

| Konnected Alarm Panel Zone  | NodeMCU pin  | IO Index  | ESP8266 GPIO |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | D1  | 1  | GPIO5  |
| 2 | D2  | 2  | GPIO4  |
| 3 | D5  | 5  | GPIO14 |
| 4 | D6  | 6  | GPIO12 |
| 5 | D7  | 7  | GPIO13 |
| 6 | RX  | 9  | GPIO3  |
| ALARM or OUT | D8 | 8 | GPIO15 |

### Binary Sensor

The `konnected` binary sensor allows you to monitor wired door sensors, window sensors, motion sensors, smoke detectors, CO detectors, glass-break sensors, water leak sensors or any other simple wired open/close circuit attached to a NodeMCU ESP8266 WiFi module running the [open source Konnected software](https://github.com/konnected-io/konnected-security).

This integration supports all of the built-in device classes of the generic [Binary Sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor/) component.

### Switch

The `konnected` switch platform allows you to actuate an alarm system siren, strobe light, buzzer or any other wired device using a [Konnected Alarm Panel board](https://konnected.io) or relay module and a NodeMCU ESP8266 WiFi module running the [open source Konnected software](https://github.com/konnected-io/konnected-security).
