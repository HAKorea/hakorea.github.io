The [MySensors](https://www.mysensors.org) project combines devices like Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, NRF24L01+ and RFM69 to build affordable sensor networks. This integration will automatically add all available devices to Home Assistant, after [presentation](#presentation) is done. That is, you do not need to add anything to your configuration for the devices for them to be added. Go to the **states** section of the developer tools to find the devices that have been identified.

### Configuration

Integrate your Serial, Ethernet (LAN) or MQTT MySensors Gateway by adding the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mysensors:
  gateways:
    - device: '/dev/ttyUSB0'
```

{% configuration %}
  gateways:
    description: A list of gateways to set up.
    required: true
    type: map
    keys:
      device:
        description: The path to the serial gateway where it is connected to your Home Assistant host, or the address of the TCP Ethernet gateway, or `mqtt` to setup the MQTT gateway. Resolving DNS addresses is theoretically supported but not tested.
        required: true
        type: string
      baud_rate:
        description: Specifies the baud rate of the connected serial gateway.
        required: false
        type: integer
        default: 115200
      persistence_file:
        description: The path to a file to save sensor information. The file extension determines the file type. Currently supported file types are 'pickle' and 'json'.
        required: false
        type: string
        default: path/to/config/directory/mysensors.pickle
      tcp_port:
        description: Specifies the port of the connected TCP Ethernet gateway.
        required: false
        type: integer
        default: 5003
      topic_in_prefix:
        description: Set the prefix of the MQTT topic for messages coming from the MySensors gateway in to Home Assistant.
        required: false
        type: string
        default: ''
      topic_out_prefix:
        description: Set the prefix of the MQTT topic for messages going from Home Assistant out to the MySensors gateway.
        required: false
        type: string
        default: ''
      nodes:
        description: A mapping of node ids to node settings, e.g. custom name.
        required: false
        type: map
        keys:
          name:
            description: The name the node will be renamed to. This node name becomes part of the entity_id. Default entity_id is [sketch_name]\_[node_id]\_[child_id] and when this name is set, the entity_id becomes [name]\_[child_id].
            required: true
            type: string
  persistence:
    description: Enable or disable local persistence of sensor information. If this is disabled, then each sensor will need to send presentation messages after Home Assistant starts.
    required: false
    type: integer
    default: true
  version:
    description: Specifies the MySensors protocol version to use. Supports versions 1.4 to 2.3.
    required: false
    type: string
    default: '1.4'
  optimistic:
    description: Enable or disable optimistic mode for actuators (switch/light). Set this to true if no state feedback from actuators is possible. Home Assistant will assume that the command succeeded and change state.
    required: false
    type: integer
    default: false
  retain:
    description: Enable or disable retain flag for published messages from Home Assistant when using the MQTT gateway.
    required: false
    type: integer
    default: true
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note'>
Not all features of MySensors 2.x are supported by Home Assistant yet. As more features are added, they will be described here in the documentation. Go to the MySensors platform pages under "related components" to see what message types are currently supported.
</div>

If you are using an original Arduino as a serial gateway, the port will be named `ttyACM*`. The exact number can be determined with the command shown below.

```bash
$ ls /dev/ttyACM*
```

If you are using the MQTT gateway, you also need to have the [MQTT component](/integrations/mqtt/) configured in Home Assistant. See below for a minimum MQTT configuration:

```yaml
mqtt:
  client_id: home-assistant-1
```

<div class='note'>
The MQTT gateway requires MySensors version 2.0+ and only the MQTT client gateway is supported.
</div>

### Presentation

Present a MySensors sensor or actuator, by following these steps:

1. Connect the serial gateway to your computer or the Ethernet or MQTT gateway to your network.
2. Configure the MySensors integration in `configuration.yaml`.
3. Start Home Assistant.
4. Write and upload your MySensors sketch to the sensor. Make sure you:
    - Send sketch name.
    - Present the sensor's `S_TYPE`.
    - Send at least one initial value per `V_TYPE`. In version 2.x of MySensors, this has to be done in the loop function. See below for an example in 2.0 of how to make sure the initial value has been received by the controller.
5. Start the sensor.

  }

    if (debouncer.read()==LOW) {
      state = !state;
      // Send new state and request ack back
      send(msg.set(state?RELAY_ON:RELAY_OFF), true);
    }
  }
}

void receive(const MyMessage &message) {
  if (message.isAck()) {
     Serial.println("This is an ack from gateway");
  }

  if (message.type == V_STATUS) {
    if (!initialValueSent) {
      Serial.println("Receiving initial value from controller");
      initialValueSent = true;
    }
    // Change relay state
    state = (bool)message.getInt();
    digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, state?RELAY_ON:RELAY_OFF);
    send(msg.set(state?RELAY_ON:RELAY_OFF));
  }
}
```

### SmartSleep

Sending a heartbeat, `I_HEARTBEAT_RESPONSE`, from the MySensors device to Home Assistant, using MySensors version 2.0 - 2.1, activates the SmartSleep functionality in Home Assistant. This means that messages are buffered and only sent to the device upon receiving a heartbeat from the device. State changes are stored so that only the last requested state change is sent to the device. Other types of messages are queued in a FIFO queue. SmartSleep is useful for battery powered actuators that are waiting for commands. See the MySensors library API for information on how to send heartbeats and sleep the device.

In MySensors version 2.2 the serial API changed from using `I_HEARTBEAT_RESPONSE` to signal SmartSleep, to using `I_PRE_SLEEP_NOTIFICATION` and `I_POST_SLEEP_NOTIFICATION`. Home Assistant has been upgraded to support the new message types and will activate SmartSleep when receiving a message of type `I_PRE_SLEEP_NOTIFICATION`, if using MySensors version 2.2.x or higher. If Home Assistant is configured to use MySensors version 2.0 - 2.1 the old SmartSleep behavior is retained.

### Message validation

Messages sent to or from Home Assistant from or to a MySensors device will be validated according to the MySensors [serial API](https://www.mysensors.org/download/serial_api_20). If a message doesn't pass validation, it will be dropped and not be passed forward either to or from Home Assistant. Make sure you follow the serial API for your version of MySensors when writing your Arduino sketch.

The log should warn you of messages that failed validation or if a child value is missing that is required for a certain child type. Home Assistant will log failed validations of child values at warning level if e.g. one required value type for a platform has been received, but other required value types are missing.

Message validation was introduced in version 0.52 of Home Assistant.

### Debug logging

If you experience dropped messages or that a device is not added to Home Assistant, please turn on debug logging for the `mysensors` integration and the `mysensors` package. This will help you see what is going on. Make sure you use these logging settings to collect a log sample if you report an issue about the `mysensors` integration in our github issue tracker.
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.mysensors: debug
    mysensors: debug
```
