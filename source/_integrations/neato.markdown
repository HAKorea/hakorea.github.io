The `neato` integration allows you to control your [Neato Botvac Connected Robots](https://www.neatorobotics.com/robot-vacuum/botvac-connected-series/).

To activate `neato` in your installation, you can set it up from the integration screen or add it to your `configuration.yaml` file.

## Setup the integration via the integrations screen

Menu: *Configuration* -> *Integrations*

Search for or select **Neato** from the list and configure the integration. You will need to enter your username and password and whether you are using a Neato or Vorwerk device.
After that, all the entities will automatically show up in Home Assistant.

## Setup the integration via configuration.yaml

Add the following to your configuration.yaml:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
neato:
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
username:
  description: Username for the Neato account.
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: Password for the Neato account.
  required: true
  type: string
vendor:
  description: Support for additional vendors. Set to `vorwerk` for Vorwerk robots.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: neato
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note'>

After the update to firmware 4.0 (which adds cleaning maps) there is also support for displaying the maps of the Botvac D3 Connected and Botvac D5 Connected robots. More information on how to update can be found [here](https://support.neatorobotics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004320694-Software-Update-4-0-for-Neato-Botvac-Connected-D3-D5-).

## Vacuum

The `neato` vacuum platform allows you to control your [Neato Botvac Connected](https://www.neatorobotics.com/robot-vacuum/botvac-connected-series/).
The status will contain attributes on the robots last clean session.

<div class='note'>
If you notice the robot stops responding to commands check the state to see if the robot is "unavailable". If you see "unavailable" first try to restart the vacuum and wait about 5 minutes to see if it is no longer "unavailable". If you are still having issues check the Neato app and make sure your robot is connected and working. If it is not then follow the steps in the app to reset your robot and give it the same name as before then restart Home Assistant.
