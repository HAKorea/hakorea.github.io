The `rpi_camera` platform allows you to integrate the Raspberry Pi camera into Home Assistant. This integration uses the application [`raspistill`](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/raspistill.md) to store the image from camera.

## Configuration

To enable this camera in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
camera:
  - platform: rpi_camera
```

{% configuration %}
image_width:

  required: false
  type: string

file_path:

{% endconfiguration %}

The given **file_path** must be an existing file because the camera platform setup performs a writeable check on it. Also, keep in mind that the path should be [whitelisted](/docs/configuration/basic/).
