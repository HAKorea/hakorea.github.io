The `solarlog` integration uses the open JSON interface on [Solar-Log PV monitoring systems](https://www.solar-log.com/) to allow you to get details from your Solar-Log device and integrate these into your Home Assistant installation.

Before being able to use the integration, you have to activate the open JSON interface on your Solar-Log device. This can be activated from the Configuration | System | Access control menu of your Solar-Log device. 
When activating the interface, a red warning triangle with security information and risks is displayed.

The `solarlog` integration uses the default host address "http://solar-log" if you don't specify a host. If your device isn't accessible on this address, use its IP Address instead.

<div class='note warning'>
The open JSON interface is deactivated by default. To activate the open JSON interface, a user password must first be set. The password isn't needed for accessing the open JSON interface.
</div>

## Configuration

There are 2 options in configuring the `solarlog` integration:

- Via the Home Assistant user interface where it will let you enter the name and host to connect to your Solar-Log device.
- Via the Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` file.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  platform: solarlog
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The IP Address or host address of your Solar-Log device.
  required: false
  default: http://solar-log
  type: string
name:
  description: Let you overwrite the name of the device in the frontend.
  required: false
  default: solarlog
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

### Full configuration sample

A full configuration entry would look like the sample below.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: solarlog
    name: solarlog
    host: 192.168.1.123
```

In case you would like to convert the values, for example, to Wh instead of the default kWh, you can use the [template platform](/integrations/template/).

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for sensor template platform
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      solarlog_yield_day_template:
        value_template: "{{ (states('sensor.solarlog_yield_day') | float * 1000) | round(0) }}"
```
{% endraw %}

## Sensors

The following sensors are available in the library:

| name                  | Unit   | Description   |
|-----------------------|--------|:-------------------------------------------|
| last_update           |        | Time of latest data update.                |
| power_ac              | W      | Total output PAC from all of the inverters and meters in inverter mode. |
| power_dc              | W      | Total output PAC from all of the inverters. |
| voltage_ac            | V      | Average voltage AC from the inverter. |
| voltage_dc            | V      | Average voltage DC from the inverter |

| efficiency            | % W/Wp | Efficiency (equals to power_ac / power_dc |
| power_available       | W      | Available power (equals to power_ac - consumption_ac) | 
| usage                 |        | Usage (equals to consumption_ac / power_ac) |

<div class='note'>
The solarlog integration is using the sunwatcher pypi package to get the data from your Solar-Log device. The last five sensors are not reported by your Solar-Log device directly, but are computed by the sunwatcher package.
