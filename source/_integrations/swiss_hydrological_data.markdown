The `swiss_hydrological_data` sensor will show you details (temperature, level, and discharge) of rivers and lakes in Switzerland.

## Setup

The [station overview](https://www.hydrodaten.admin.ch/en/stations-and-data.html) contains a list of all available measuring points and will help to determine the ID of station which is needed for the configuration.

## Configuration

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: swiss_hydrological_data
    station: STATION_ID
    monitored_conditions:
      - temperature
      - level
      - discharge
```

{% configuration %}
station:
  description: The ID of the measurement point.
  required: true
  type: string
monitored_conditions:
  description: The list of measurements you want to use. Available is `temperature`, `level` or `discharge`.
  required: false
  type: list
  default: temperature
{% endconfiguration %}

Sensors are exposing additional values through their attributes for all available conditions:

- `delta-24h`: The delta measurement for the last 24 hours.
- `max-1h`: The maximum measurement for the last hour.
- `max-24h`: The maximum measurement for the last 24 hours.
- `mean-1h`: The mean measurement for the last hour.
- `mean-24h`: The mean measurement for the last 24 hours.
- `min-1h`: The minimum measurement for the last hour.
- `min-24h`: The minimum measurement for the last 24 hours.
- `previous-24h`: The previous measurement for the last 24 hours.
- `station_update`: There is a time span between the sensor update in Home Assistant and the updates from the stations. Include those information if you are building automations based on the discharge of a water body.

<div class='note info'>
  The sensors don't show the latest measurement, but those from the last hour due to the source of data. Some stations also don't provide data for certain measurements.

The hydrological measurements are coming from the [Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (Bundesamt f√ºr Umwelt - Abt. Hydrologie)](https://www.hydrodaten.admin.ch/) and are updated every 10 minutes.
