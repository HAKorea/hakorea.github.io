The `group` notification platform allows you to combine multiple `notify` platforms into a single service.

## Configuration

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - name: NAME_OF_NOTIFIER_GROUP
    platform: group
    services:
      - service: html5
        data:
          target: "macbook"
      - service: html5_nexus
```

{% configuration %}
name:
  description: Setting the parameter `name` sets the name of the group.
  required: true
  type: string
services:
  description: A list of all the services to be included in the group.
  required: true
  type: list
  keys:
    service:
      description: The service part of an entity ID, e.g. if you use `notify.html5` normally, just put `html5`. Note that you must put everything in lower case here. Although you might have capitals written in the actual notification services!
      required: true
      type: string
    data:
      description: A dictionary containing parameters to add to all notify payloads. This can be anything that is valid to use in a payload, such as `data`, `message`, `target` or `title`.
      required: false
      type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Example

An example on how to use it in an automation:

{% raw %}
```yaml
action:
  service: notify.NAME_OF_NOTIFIER_GROUP
  data:
    message: "The sun is {% if is_state('sun.sun', 'above_horizon') %}up{% else %}down{% endif %}!"
```
{% endraw %}
