The `statistics` sensor platform consumes the state from other sensors. It exports the `mean` value as state and the following values as attributes: `count`, `mean`, `median`, `stdev`, `variance`, `total`, `min_value`, `max_value`, `min_age`, `max_age`, `change`, `average_change` and `change_rate`. If it's a binary sensor then only state changes are counted.

If you are running the [recorder](/integrations/recorder/) component, on startup the data is read from the database. So after a restart of the platform, you will immediately have data available. If you're using the [history](/integrations/history/) component, this will automatically also start the `recorder` integration on startup.
If you are *not* running the `recorder` component, it can take time till the sensor starts to work because a couple of attributes need more than one value to do the calculation.

## Configuration

To enable the statistics sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# enable the recorder integration (optional)
recorder:

# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: statistics
    entity_id: sensor.cpu
  - platform: statistics
    entity_id: binary_sensor.movement
    max_age:
      minutes: 30
```
