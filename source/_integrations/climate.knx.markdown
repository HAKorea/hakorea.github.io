<div class='note'>
  
The `knx` integration must be configured correctly to use this integration, see [KNX Integration](/integrations/knx).

</div>

The `knx` climate platform is used as an interface to KNX thermostats and room controllers.

To use your KNX thermostats in your installation, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
climate:
   - platform: knx
     name: HASS-Kitchen.Temperature
     temperature_address: '5/1/1'
     setpoint_shift_address: '5/1/2'
     setpoint_shift_state_address: '5/1/3'
     target_temperature_state_address: '5/1/4'
     operation_mode_address: '5/1/5'
     operation_mode_state_address: '5/1/6'
```

Alternatively, if your device has dedicated binary group addresses for frost/night/comfort mode:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
climate:
  - platform: knx
    name: HASS-Kitchen.Temperature
    temperature_address: '5/1/1'
    setpoint_shift_address: '5/1/2'
    setpoint_shift_state_address: '5/1/3'
    target_temperature_state_address: '5/1/4'
    operation_mode_frost_protection_address: '5/1/5'
    operation_mode_night_address: '5/1/6'
    operation_mode_comfort_address: '5/1/7'
    operation_mode_state_address: '5/1/8'
```

If your device doesn't support setpoint_shift calculations (i.e. if you don't provide a `setpoint_shift_address` value) please set the `min_temp` and `max_temp`
attributes of the climate device to avoid issues with exceeding valid temperature values in the frontend. Please do also make sure to add the `target_temperature_address`
to the config in this case.:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
climate:
  - platform: knx
    name: HASS-Kitchen.Temperature
    temperature_address: '5/1/2'
    target_temperature_address: '5/1/4'
    target_temperature_state_address: '5/1/1'
    operation_mode_frost_protection_address: '5/1/5'
    operation_mode_night_address: '5/1/6'
    operation_mode_comfort_address: '5/1/7'
    operation_mode_state_address: '5/1/8'
    min_temp: 7.0
    max_temp: 32.0
```

`operation_mode_frost_protection_address` / `operation_mode_night_address` / `operation_mode_comfort_address` are not necessary if `operation_mode_address` is specified.
If the actor doesn't support explicit state communication objects the *_state_address can be configured with the same group address as the writeable *_address. The Read-Flag for the *_state_address communication object has to be set in ETS to support initial reading eg. when starting home-assistant.

The following values are valid for the `hvac_mode` attribute:

- Off (maps internally to HVAC_MODE_OFF within Home Assistant)
- Auto (maps internally to HVAC_MODE_AUTO within Home Assistant)
- Heat (maps internally to HVAC_MDOE_HEAT within Home Assistant)
- Cool (maps internally to HVAC_MDOE_COOL within Home Assistant)
- Fan only (maps internally to HVAC_MODE_FAN_ONLY within Home Assistant)
- Dry (maps internally to HVAC_MODE_DRY within Home Assistant)

The following presets are valid for the `preset_mode` attribute:

- Comfort (maps internally to PRESET_COMFORT within Home Assistant)
- Standby (maps internally to PRESET_AWAY within Home Assistant)
- Night (maps internally to PRESET_SLEEP within Home Assistant)
- Frost Protection (maps internally to PRESET_ECO within Home Assistant)
