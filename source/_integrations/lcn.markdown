The `lcn` integration for Home Assistant allows you to connect to [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) hardware devices.

The integration requires one unused license of the coupling software LCN-PCHK (version >2.8) and an LCN hardware coupler. Alternatively, an LCN-PKE coupler can be used which offers two PCHK licenses.
With this setup sending and receiving commands to and from LCN modules is possible.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary Sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Climate](#climate)
- [Cover](#cover)
- [Light](#light)
- [Scene](#scene)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)

<div class='note'>

  Please note: Besides the implemented platforms, the `lcn` integration offers a variety of [service calls](#services).
  These service calls cover functionalities of the LCN system, which cannot be represented by the platform implementations.
  They are ideal to be used in automation scripts or for the `template` platforms.

</div>

## Configuration

To use your LCN system in your installation, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file.
You have to specify at least one IP/port with login credentials for a PCHK host.
Consider to store your credentials in a [secrets.yaml](/docs/configuration/secrets).

## LCN Addresses

LCN hardware devices connected to the LCN bus are called _modules_. LCN modules are addressed by their numeric id in the range (5..254).

Modules can be arranged in _segments_. Segments can be addressed by their numeric id (5..128) or 0 (= no segment exist) or 3 (= target all segments).

LCN Modules within the _same_ segment can be grouped by their group id (5..254) or 3 (= target all groups.)

The LCN integration allows the connection to more than one hardware coupler. In this case, it has to be specified which hardware coupler should be used for addressing the specified module.

Whenever the address of a module or a group has to be specified, it can be addressed using one of the following syntaxes:

Example for modules:

```txt
connid.s000.m007
connid.s0.m7
s0.m7
0.7
```

Example for groups:

```txt
connid.s000.g007
connid.s0.g7
s0.g7
0.g7
```

Leading zeroes in the segment id or module/group id can be omitted. If the `connection_id` is omitted, the first connection defined in the [configuration](#configuration) will be used.

## LCN Constants

The platforms and service calls use several predefined constants as parameters.

### Ports

| Constant | Values |
| -------- | ------ |
| OUTPUT_PORT | `output1`, `output2`, `output3`, `output4` |
| RELAY_PORT | `relay1`, `relay2`, `relay3`, `relay4`, `relay5`, `relay6`, `relay7`, `relay8` |

| LOGICOP_STATE | `not`, `or`, `and` |
| KEY_STATE | `hit`, `make`, `break`, `dontsend` |

### Keys:

Whenever a key has to be provided, it is defined by a joint string consisting of the table identifier (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and the corresponding key number.
Examples: `a1`, `a5`, `d8`.

## Platforms

### Binary Sensor

The `lcn` binary sensor platform allows the monitoring of the following [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) binary data sources:

- Binary hardware sensors
- Lock state of regulator setpoints
- Lock state of keys

The binary sensor can be used in automation scripts or in conjunction with `template` platforms.

### Climate

The `lcn` climate platform allows the control of the [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) climate regulators.
This platform depends on the correct configuration of the module's regulators, which has to be done in the LCN-PRO programming software.
You need to specify at least the variable for the current temperature and a setpoint variable for the target temperature.
If the control is set lockable, the regulator can be turned on/off.

<div class='note'>

If you intend to leave the regulation to Home Assistant, you should consider using the [Generic Thermostat](/integrations/generic_thermostat/) in conjunction with [LCN Sensor](#sensor) and [LCN Switch](#switch).

</div>

### Cover

The `lcn` cover platform allows the control of [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) relays and output ports which have been configured as motor controllers.

Only for the module with firmware earlier than 190C:<br>
The configuration allows the optional definition of reverse time. This is the time which is waited during the switching of the motor currents.
The reverse time should only be defined when using the [MOTOR_PORT](#ports) value `OUTPUTS`. For all other configuration, the reverse time has to be defined in the LCN Pro software.
For the reverse time, you may choose one of the following constants: `RT70` (70ms), `RT600` (600ms), `RT1200` (1,2s).

<p class='note'>
If you are using the module's output ports for motor control, ensure that you have configured the output ports as motor controllers in the LCN Pro software!
Otherwise, the output ports are not mutually interlocked and you run the risk of destroying the motor.
</p>


### Light

The `lcn` light platform allows the control of the following [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) ports:

- (Dimmable) output ports
- Relays

### Scene

The `lcn` scene platform allows the activation of previously programmed [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) scenes.

### Sensor

The `lcn` sensor platform allows the monitoring of the following [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) data sources:

- Variables
- Regulator setpoints
- Thresholds
- S0 inputs
- LED states
- Logic operation states

The sensor can be used in automation scripts or in conjunction with `template` platforms.

<div class='note'>
  Ensure that the LCN module is configured properly to provide the requested value.
  Otherwise, the module might show unexpected behavior or return error messages.
</div>

### Switch

The `lcn` switch platform allows the control of the following [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) ports:

- Output ports
- Relays

## Services
