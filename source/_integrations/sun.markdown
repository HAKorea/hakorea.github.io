The sun integration will use your current location to track if the sun is above or
below the horizon. The sun can be used within automation as
[a trigger with an optional offset to simulate dawn/dusk][sun_trigger] or as [a condition with an optional offset to test if the sun has already set or risen][sun_condition].

[sun_trigger]: /docs/automation/trigger/#sun-trigger
[sun_condition]: /docs/scripts/conditions/#sun-condition

## Configuration

This integration is by default enabled, unless you've disabled or removed the [`default_config:`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/default_config/) line from your configuration. If that is the case, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sun:
```

{% configuration %}
elevation:
  description: "The (physical) elevation of your location, in meters above sea level. Defaults to the `elevation` in `configuration.yaml`, which is retrieved from Google Maps if not set."
  required: false
  type: integer
{% endconfiguration %}

## Implementation Details

The sun's event listener will call the service when the sun rises or sets with
an offset.

The sun event need to have the type 'sun', which service to call,
which event (sunset or sunrise) and the offset.

```json
{
    "type": "sun",
    "service": "switch.turn_on",
    "event": "sunset",
    "offset": "-01:00:00"
}
```
