This integration allows you to send messages to [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com) conversations, as well as to react to messages in conversations. Reacting to commands is accomplished by firing an event when one of the configured commands is triggered. Home Assistant will impersonate a Smartisan YQ603 phone which will then show up in your Google devices.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Notifications](#notifications)

## Setup the integration via the frontend

Menu: *Configuration* -> *Integrations*

Configure the integration:
* Enter your **Google Mail Address** and **Password**
* In the authentication form there is an Optional Field: **Authorization Code** which should only be used if you get an invalid login error with email and password (see note below for details).
* If you secured your account with 2-factor authentication you will be asked for a 2-factor authentication token.

## Manual Authentication

If you are sure your email and password are correct, but the integration says the login is invalid then you would need to use the manual authentication method.

To use the manual method, first you would need to obtain an authorization code (see <a href="#steps-to-obtain-authorization-code">instructions below</a> for details).

Once the code is obtained fill in the form with your email, password and the authorization code to complete authentication.

### Steps to obtain Authorization Code:

1. To obtain your authorization code, open [this URL](https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/programmatic_auth?scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Faccounts%2FOAuthLogin+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fuserinfo.email&client_id=936475272427.apps.googleusercontent.com&device_name=hangups) in your browser.
2. Log into your Google account normally.
3. You should be redirected to a loading screen. Copy the `oauth_code` cookie value set by this page and paste it here.

To obtain the `oauth_code` cookie value using Chrome or Firefox, follow the steps below:

* Press F12 to open developer tools.
* Select the "Application" (Chrome) or "Storage" (Firefox) tab.
* In the sidebar, expand "Cookies" and select `https://accounts.google.com`
* In the cookie list, double click on the value for the `oauth_code` cookie to select it, and copy the value. This is the authorization code

<div class='note'>
You can't write messages to yourself or get notifications in a group, if "you" write the message. The best way is to create a new Google Hangouts account for this integration.<br>
<br>
If you secured your account with 2-factor authentication: Only verification by app or SMS are supported. There is no support for verification by prompt on your phone.<br>
<br>
The manual authentication work-around is a result of unofficial support for using bots in hangouts from Google.
</div>

The authentication token will be generated and stored internally.

{% endconfiguration %}

The conversations has to be precreated, the conversation id can be obtained from the `hangouts.conversations` entity. Make sure to use quotes around the conversation id or alias to escape special characters (`!`, and `#`) in YAML.

The intent `HangoutsHelp` is part of the integration and return a list of all sentences the integration unterstand in this conversation.

## Adding sentences

{% raw %}

```yaml
# The Hangouts component
hangouts:
  intents:
    HassLightSet:
      sentences:
        - Toggle {name}.
      conversations:
        - id: CONVERSATION_ID1
    Ping:
      sentences:
        - How many Conversation do you know
  error_suppressed_conversations:
    - id: CONVERSATION_ID2

intent_script:
  Ping:
    speech:
      text: I know {{ states('hangouts.conversations') }} conversations
```

{% endraw %}

This configuration will:

- Toggle the light in the given location in a specific conversation.
- Return the conversations the bot know.

## Adding advanced custom sentences

Sentences can contain slots (marked with curly braces: `{name}`) and optional words (marked with square brackets: `[the]`). The values of slots will be passed on to the intent and are available inside the templates.

The following configuration can handle the following sentences:

- Change the lights to red
- Change the lights to green
- Change the lights to blue
- Change the lights to the color red
- Change the lights to the color green
- Change the lights to the color blue

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
hangouts:
  intents:
    ColorLight:
      sentences:
        - Change the lights to [the color] {color}

intent_script:
  ColorLight:
    speech:
      text: Changed the lights to {{ color }}.
    action:
      service: light.turn_on
      data_template:
        rgb_color:
          - "{% if color == 'red' %}255{% else %}0{% endif %}"
          - "{% if color == 'green' %}255{% else %}0{% endif %}"
          - "{% if color == 'blue' %}255{% else %}0{% endif %}"
```

{% endraw %}

## Advanced

### Automatic reconnect after IP change

The hangouts integration can't detect if your IP address changes, so it can't automatic reconnect to the Google servers. This is a workaround for this problem.

{% raw %}

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: rest
    resource: https://api.ipify.org/?format=json
    name: External IP
    value_template: '{{ value_json.ip }}'
    scan_interval: 10

automation:
  - alias: Reconnect Hangouts
    trigger:
      - entity_id: sensor.external_ip
        platform: state
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: '{{ trigger.from_state.state != trigger.to_state.state }}'
      - condition: template
        value_template: '{{ not is_state("sensor.external_ip", "unavailable") }}'
    action:
      - service: hangouts.reconnect
```

{% endraw %}

## Notifications

The `hangouts` platform allows you to deliver notifications from Home Assistant to [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) conversations. Conversations can be both direct as well as group chats.

To enable Hangouts notifications in your installation, you first need to configure the Hangouts component. Then, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry  
notify:
  - name: NOTIFIER_NAME
    platform: hangouts
    default_conversations:
      - id: CONVERSATION_ID1
      - id: CONVERSATION_ID2
```

{% configuration %}
name:
  description: "Setting the optional parameter `name` allows multiple notifiers to be created. The default value is `notify`. The notifier will bind to the service `notify.NOTIFIER_NAME`."
  required: false
  type: string
default_conversations:
  description: "The conversations all messages will be sent to, when no other target is given."
  required: true
  type: [map]
  keys:
    id:
      description: "Specifies the id of the conversation. *The conversation id can be obtained from the `hangouts.conversations` entity.*"
      required: true
      type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

### Finding the conversation ID

The conversations has to be precreated, the conversation id can be obtained from the `hangouts.conversations` entity, this can be found in with the states developer tool that is shown as this icon <img src='/images/screenshots/developer-tool-states-icon.png' class='no-shadow' height='38' /> in the side bar. Using your web browsers search tool to find the `hangouts.conversations` entity. You will find something like below.

```json
0: {
  "id": "<Hangout ID>",
  "name": "A simple hangout",
  "users": [
    "Steve",
    "Jo"
  ]
}
```

This may have more if the account is in multiple hangout conversations, for configuring the bot to be in a conversation you will need the ID that would be where `<Hangout ID>` is in that example. Make sure to use quotes around the conversation id or alias to escape special characters (`!`, and `#`) in YAML.

To use notifications, please see the [getting started with automation page](/getting-started/automation/).
