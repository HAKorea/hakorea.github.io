## Default schema

The `mqtt` light platform with default schema lets you control your MQTT enabled lights. It supports setting brightness, color temperature, effects, flashing, on/off, RGB colors, transitions, XY colors and white values.

## Default schema - Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a state topic to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT light will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the switch will be `false` / `off`.

When a state topic is not available, the light will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the light will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the light will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if the `state_topic` is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect light operation.

## Default schema - Examples

In this section you will find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

### Brightness and RGB support

To enable a light with brightness and RGB support in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Office Light RGB"
    state_topic: "office/rgb1/light/status"
    command_topic: "office/rgb1/light/switch"
    brightness_state_topic: "office/rgb1/brightness/status"
    brightness_command_topic: "office/rgb1/brightness/set"
    rgb_state_topic: "office/rgb1/rgb/status"
    rgb_command_topic: "office/rgb1/rgb/set"
    state_value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
    brightness_value_template: "{{ value_json.brightness }}"
    rgb_value_template: "{{ value_json.rgb | join(',') }}"
    qos: 0
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    optimistic: false
```
{% endraw %}

### Brightness and no RGB support

To enable a light with brightness (no RGB version) in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Office light"
    state_topic: "office/light/status"
    command_topic: "office/light/switch"
    brightness_state_topic: 'office/light/brightness'
    brightness_command_topic: 'office/light/brightness/set'
    qos: 0
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    optimistic: false
```

### Brightness without on commands

To enable a light that sends only brightness topics to turn it on, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file. The `command_topic` is only used to send an off command in this case:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Brightness light"
    state_topic: "office/light/status"
    command_topic: "office/light/switch"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    brightness_state_topic: 'office/light/brightness'
    brightness_command_topic: 'office/light/brightness/set'
    on_command_type: 'brightness'
```

## Default schema - Implementations

- A [basic example](https://github.com/mertenats/open-home-automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_light) using a nodeMCU board (ESP8266) to control its built-in LED (on/off).
- Another [example](https://github.com/mertenats/open-home-automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_rgb_light) to control a RGB LED (on/off, brightness, and colors).
- [Integration guide](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/wiki/HomeAssistant) for the ESPUrna firmware (ESP8285/ESP8266).

## JSON schema

The `mqtt` light platform with JSON schema lets you control a MQTT-enabled light that can receive [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) messages.

This schema supports on/off, brightness, RGB colors, XY colors, color temperature, transitions, short/long flashing and white values. The messages sent to/from the lights look similar to this, omitting fields when they aren't needed:

```json
{
  "brightness": 255,
  "color_temp": 155,
  "color": {
    "r": 255,
    "g": 180,
    "b": 200,
    "x": 0.406,
    "y": 0.301,
    "h": 344.0,
    "s": 29.412
  },
  "effect": "colorloop",
  "state": "ON",
  "transition": 2,
  "white_value": 150
}
```

## JSON schema - Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a state topic to publish state changes. If these messages are published with the RETAIN flag, the MQTT light will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the light will be off.

When a state topic is not available, the light will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the light will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the light will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if state topic is available. Try enabling it if the light is operating incorrectly.

    state_topic: "home/rgb1"
    command_topic: "home/rgb1/set"
    brightness: true
    rgb: true
```

### Brightness and no RGB support

To enable a light with brightness (but no color support) in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/rgb1"
    command_topic: "home/rgb1/set"
    brightness: true
```

### Brightness Scaled

To enable a light using a brightness scale other than 8bit the `brightness_scale` option may be added to denote the "fully on" value:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/light"
    command_topic: "home/light/set"
    brightness: true
    brightness_scale: 4095
```

Home Assistant will then convert its 8bit value in the message to and from the device:

```json
{
  "brightness": 4095,
  "state": "ON"
}
```

### HS Color

To use a light with hue+saturation as the color model, set `hs` to `true` in the platform configuration:

```yaml
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_hs_light
    state_topic: "home/light"
    command_topic: "home/light/set"
    hs: true
```

Home Assistant expects the hue values to be in the range 0 to 360 and the saturation values to be scaled from 0 to 100. For example, the following is a blue color shade:

```json
{
  "state": "ON",
  "color": {
    "h": 24.0,
    "s": 100.0
  }
}
```

### Brightness and RGBW support

To enable a light with brightness, RGB support and a separate white channel (RGBW) in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/rgbw1"
    command_topic: "home/rgbw1/set"
    brightness: true
    rgb: true
    white_value: true
```


## Implementations

- A full example of custom lighting using this platform and an ESP8266 microcontroller can be found [here](https://github.com/corbanmailloux/esp-mqtt-rgb-led). It supports on/off, brightness, transitions, RGB colors, and flashing.

- There is also another implementation forked from the above repo, it supports all the same features but is made for addressable LED strips using FastLED on a NodeMCU V3 it can be found [here](https://github.com/JammyDodger231/nodemcu-mqtt-rgb-led).

- [McLighting](https://github.com/toblum/McLighting) is another ESP8266 firmware for WS2812 addressable LEDs.

- [MQTT JSON Light](https://github.com/mertenats/Open-Home-Automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_rgbw_light_with_discovery) is another implementation for ESP8266 including [MQTT discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/).

- [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) implements the JSON schema for MQTT based installs and supports [MQTT discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/).

- [AiLight](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight) is a custom firmware for the Ai-Thinker (and equivalent) RGBW WiFi light bulbs that has an ESP8266 onboard and controlled by the MY9291 LED driver. It implements the [MQTT JSON light](/integrations/light.mqtt) platform and supports ON/OFF, RGBW colours, brightness, colour temperature, flashing and transitions. Also it includes [MQTT Auto Discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/)) and the MQTT Last Will and Testament is enabled as well.

- [h801-mqtt-json](https://github.com/starkillerOG/h801-mqtt-json) is a custom firmware for the H801 LED dimmer, a 5 channel (RGBWWCW)  WiFi LED strip controller for 12V LED strips. The firmware is meant to control the 5 channels of the H801 to simultaneously control an RGB and a Warm-white/Cold-white Led strip such as a 5050 RGB LED strip and a 5025 Dual White strip. It implements the [MQTT JSON light](/integrations/light.mqtt) platform and supports ON/OFF, RGBW colours (RGB strip), brightness, color temperature (CW/WW strip) and transitions.

## Template schema

The `mqtt` light platform with template schema lets you control a MQTT-enabled light that receive commands on a command topic and optionally sends status update on a state topic.
It is format-agnostic so you can use any data format you want (i.e. string, JSON), just configure it with templating.

This schema supports on/off, brightness, RGB colors, XY colors, color temperature, transitions, short/long flashing, effects and white values.

## Template schema - Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a state topic to publish state changes. If these messages are published with the RETAIN flag, the MQTT light will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the light will be off.

When a state topic is not available, the light will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the light will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the light will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if state topic is available. Try enabling it if the light is operating incorrectly.

  - platform: mqtt

    command_topic: "home/rgb1/set"

## Template schema - Examples

In this section you find some real-life examples of how to use this light.

### Simple string payload

For a simple string payload with the format `state,brightness,r-g-b` (e.g., `on,255,255-255-255`), add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: template
    command_topic: "home/rgb1/set"
    state_topic: "home/rgb1/status"
    command_on_template: "{% raw %}on,{{ brightness|d }},{{ red|d }}-{{ green|d }}-{{ blue|d }}{% endraw %}"
    command_off_template: "off"
    state_template: "{% raw %}{{ value.split(',')[0] }}{% endraw %}"  # must return `on` or `off`
    brightness_template: "{% raw %}{{ value.split(',')[1] }}{% endraw %}"
    red_template: "{% raw %}{{ value.split(',')[2].split('-')[0] }}{% endraw %}"
    green_template: "{% raw %}{{ value.split(',')[2].split('-')[1] }}{% endraw %}"
    blue_template: "{% raw %}{{ value.split(',')[2].split('-')[2] }}{% endraw %}"
```

### JSON payload

For a JSON payload with the format `{"state": "on", "brightness": 255, "color": [255, 255, 255], "effect": "rainbow"}`, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: template
    effect_list:
      - rainbow
      - colorloop
    command_topic: "home/rgb1/set"
    state_topic: "home/rgb1/status"
    command_on_template: >{% raw %}
      {"state": "on"
      {%- if brightness is defined -%}
      , "brightness": {{ brightness }}
      {%- endif -%}
      {%- if red is defined and green is defined and blue is defined -%}
      , "color": [{{ red }}, {{ green }}, {{ blue }}]
      {%- endif -%}
      {%- if effect is defined -%}
      , "effect": "{{ effect }}"
      {%- endif -%}
      }{% endraw %}
    command_off_template: '{"state": "off"}'
