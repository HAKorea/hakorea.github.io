The `mqtt` lock platform lets you control your MQTT enabled locks.

## Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a `state_topic` to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT lock will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the lock will be `false` / unlocked.

When a `state_topic` is not available, the lock will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the lock will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the lock will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if state topic is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect lock operation.

To enable MQTT locks in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
lock:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: "home/frontdoor/set"
```

{% configuration %}

Make sure that your topics match exactly. `some-topic/` and `some-topic` are different topics.

## Examples

In this section you will find some real-life examples of how to use this lock.

### Full configuration

The example below shows a full configuration for a MQTT lock.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
lock:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Frontdoor
    state_topic: "home-assistant/frontdoor/"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/frontdoor/set"
    payload_lock: "LOCK"
    payload_unlock: "UNLOCK"
    optimistic: false
    qos: 1
    retain: true
    value_template: '{{ value.x }}'
```
{% endraw %}

Keep an eye on retaining messages to keep the state as you don't want to unlock your door by accident when you restart something.

For a check you can use the command line tools `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` to send MQTT messages. This allows you to operate your lock manually:

```bash
$  mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/frontdoor/set -m "LOCK"
```
