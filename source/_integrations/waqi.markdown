The `waqi` sensor platform will query [World Air Quality Index](https://aqicn.org/city/beijing/) service to check AQI value for a specific set of locations. The resulting indexes will be added to the Home Assistant as sensor outputs.

## Setup

This sensor requires an API token. Please obtain one at [AQICN API token](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/#/).

The locations field is a search for a location. E.g., "brisbane" or "Brisban" would find Brisbane, Australia and all associated stations in the area.

The format for station fields is exactly from the website, e.g., you would provide the location string "[South Brisbane, Australia](http://aqicn.org/city/australia/queensland/south-brisbane/)" for the linked location.

## Configuration

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: waqi
    token: AQICN_API_TOKEN
    locations:
      - beijing
```

{% configuration %}
token:

  required: true
  type: string
locations:
  description: A list of location names to look for air quality data. In case a specific location has multiple registered stations all of them will be added to Home Assistant.
  required: true
  type: list
stations:
  description: A list of station names to look for air quality data. Station should be within locations specified above.
  required: false
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

The value reported is an overall AQ index for the location. The values of the index can be interpreted as following:

AQI | Status | Description
------- | :----------------: | ----------
0 - 50  | **Good** | Air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk
51 - 100  | **Moderate** | Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution
101 - 150 | **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups** | Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected
151 - 200 | **Unhealthy** | Everyone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects
201 - 300 | **Very unhealthy** | Health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected
301+ | **Hazardous** | Health alert: everyone may experience more serious health effects
