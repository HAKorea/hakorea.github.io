The `gpmdp` media player platform allows you to control a [GPMDP](https://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com/) instance running on a computer from Home Assistant.

You will have first have to check "Enable playback API" in GPMDP's settings and then add an inbound rule to the firewall to allow access to port 5672 on the computer running GPMDP.

Then just add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: gpmdp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
```

{% configuration %}
host:

name:

  required: false
  default: GPM Desktop Player

{% endconfiguration %}
