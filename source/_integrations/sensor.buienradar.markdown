The `buienradar` platform uses [buienradar.nl](https://buienradar.nl/) as a source for current meteorological data for your location. The weather forecast is delivered by Buienradar, who provides a webservice that provides detailed weather information for users in The Netherlands. The relevant weather station used will be automatically selected based on the location specified in the Home Assistant configuration (or in the buienradar weather/sensor component). A map of all available weather stations can be found [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1NivHkTGQUOs0dwQTnTMZi8Uatj0).

The selected weather station will provide all weather data, with the exception of the forecasted precipitation. The forecasted precipitation data will be retrieved from buienradar using your actual gps-location (and not the location of the nearest weather station).

To integrate `buienradar` with Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: buienradar
    monitored_conditions:
      - symbol
      - humidity
      - temperature
      - windspeed
      - pressure
```

## The `Name` Variable

If you specify a name, the sensors will get an entity name of `sensor.[name]_[default sensor display name]`, for example:

- `sensor.lopik_temperature`, since the name of the sensor is set to `lopik` and the default display name for monitored condition `temperature` is `Temperature`.
- `sensor.lopik_wind_force`, since the name of the sensor is set to `lopik` and the default display name for monitored condition `windforce` is `Wind force`.

If no name is specified the sensors will be called `sensor.br_[default sensor display name]`, for example:

- `sensor.br_wind_speed`, since no name has been set for the sensor and the default display name for monitored condition `windspeed` is `Wind speed`.
- `sensor.br_ground_temperature`, since no name has been set for the sensor and the default display name for monitored condition `groundtemperature` is `Ground Temperature`.

## Daily forecasts

Conditions above marked with `1d` are daily forecasts. To get forecast for different day, replace the number
in `_1d` part of the sensor name. Valid values are from `1` to `5`.
