The TP-Link LTE integration for Home Assistant allows you to observe and control TP-Link LTE routers, currently only tested with TL-MR6400 (firmware 1.4.0).

The integration provides a notification service that will send an SMS.

## Configuration

To enable the component, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml

```
