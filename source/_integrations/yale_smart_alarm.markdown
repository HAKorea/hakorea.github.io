The `yale_smart_alarm` platform provides connectivity with the Yale Smart Alarm systems and Smart Hub through Yale's API.

This platform supports the following services: `alarm_arm_away`, `alarm_arm_home`, `alarm_arm_night` (duplicate of home) and `alarm_disarm`.
Currently only one alarm is supported.

## Configuration

To enable, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: yale_smart_alarm

    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```
