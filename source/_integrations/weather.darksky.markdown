The `darksky` platform uses the [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/) web service as a source for meteorological data for your location.

## Configuration

You need an API key which is free but requires [registration](https://darksky.net/dev/register). The free tier allows up to 1000 calls per day, this platform updates at most every 3 minutes, using up to 480 of those calls.

<div class='note warning'>

[Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev/) will charge you $0.0001 per API call if you enter your credit card details and create more than 1000 calls per day.
