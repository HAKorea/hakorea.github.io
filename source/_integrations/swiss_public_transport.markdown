The `swiss_public_transport` sensor will give you the next three departure times from a given location to another one in Switzerland.

The [Swiss public transport API](https://transport.opendata.ch/) only allows 1000 requests per 24 hours.

The [Stationboard](https://transport.opendata.ch/examples/stationboard.html) website can help to determine the exact name of the start and the end station.

Then add the data to your `configuration.yaml` file as shown in the example:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: swiss_public_transport
    from: STATION_ID
    to: STATION_ID
```

{% configuration %}
from:
  description: The ID of the station of the start station.
  required: true
  type: string
to:
  description: The ID of the station of the end station.
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: The name of the sensor.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: Next Departure
{% endconfiguration %}

The public timetables are coming from [Swiss public transport](https://transport.opendata.ch/).
