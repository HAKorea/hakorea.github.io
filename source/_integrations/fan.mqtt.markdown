The `mqtt` fan platform lets you control your MQTT enabled fans.

## Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a `state_topic` to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT fan will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the fan will be `false` / `off`.

When a `state_topic` is not available, the fan will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the fan will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the fan will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced even if a `state_topic` is available. Try to enable it if you are experiencing incorrect fan operation.

To enable MQTT fans in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
fan:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: "bedroom_fan/on/set"
```
