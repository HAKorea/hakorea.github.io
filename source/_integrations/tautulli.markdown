The `tautulli` sensor platform will monitor activity on a given [Tautulli Server][tautulli]. It will create a sensor that shows the number of currently active streams as the state. If you click the sensor for more details it will show you more statistics, the following stats are available by default:

- LAN bandwidth
- Number of direct plays
- Number of direct streams
- Stream count
- Top Movie
- Top TV Show
- Top User
- Total bandwidth
- Transcode count
- WAN bandwidth

More user statistics can be added with the `monitored_conditions` configuration option, this will add one attribute per user in addition to the users current `activity`.

## Setup

To find your `api_key` open the Tautulli web interface and navigate to `Settings` and then to `Web interface`, the `api_key` will be at the bottom of that page.
