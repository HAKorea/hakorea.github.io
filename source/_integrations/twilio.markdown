The `twilio` integration enables the sending of notifications via SMS and the creation of calls with [Twilio](https://twilio.com).

A free trial account is available at [Twilio](https://twilio.com) website providing free calls to verified phone numbers.
Calls are limited to 10 minutes and will play a short trial message before your message runs. Upgraded accounts have no limitation.

## Configuration

To use this notification integration in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
twilio:
  account_sid: ACCOUNT_SID_FROM_TWILIO
  auth_token: AUTH_TOKEN_FROM_TWILIO
```

{% configuration %}
account_sid:
  description: "Your Twilio Account SID which can be found in your [console](https://www.twilio.com/console). It starts with the letters `AC`."
  required: true
  type: string
auth_token:
  description: "Your Twilio AUTH TOKEN which can be found in your [console](https://www.twilio.com/console). It should be directly under where you found the `account_sid`."
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

### Usage

After configuring the base Twilio component, add and configure either or both of the [twilio SMS](/integrations/twilio_sms) and [twilio Phone](/integrations/twilio_call) integrations to utilize the notification functionality.

To be able to receive events from Twilio, your Home Assistant instance needs to be accessible from the web ([Hass.io instructions](/addons/duckdns/)) and you need to have the `base_url` configured for the HTTP integration ([docs](/integrations/http/#base_url)).

To set it up, go to the integrations page in the configuration screen and find Twilio. Click on configure. Follow the instructions on the screen to configure Twilio.

You will get a URL of the following format: `https://<home-assistant-domain>/api/webhook/9940e99a26fae4dcf6fe0a478124b6b58b578ea4c55c9a584beb1c9f5057bb91`. To generate inbound events, you have to configure your webhooks with [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-a-webhook)

Events coming in from Twilio will be available as events in Home Assistant and are fired as `twilio_data_received`. The data specified by Twilio will be available as the event data. You can use this event to trigger automations.

You can then consume that information with the following automation:

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: twilio_data_received
    event_data:
      action: call_service
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.office
```
