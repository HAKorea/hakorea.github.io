The `smappee` integration adds support for the [Smappee](https://www.smappee.com/) controller for energy monitoring and Comport plug switches.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Sensor
- Switch

Will be automatically added when you connect to the Smappee controller.

The smappee integration gets information from [Smappee API](https://smappee.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVAPI/overview). Note: their cloud API now requires a subscription fee of €2.50 per month for Smappee Energy/Solar or €3 per month for Smappee Plus.

## Configuration

Info on how to get API access is described in the [smappy wiki](https://github.com/EnergieID/smappy/wiki).

To use the `smappee` integration in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
