The `amcrest` camera platform allows you to integrate your [Amcrest](https://amcrest.com/) IP camera in Home Assistant.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor
- Camera
- Sensor

## Configuration

To enable your camera in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
amcrest:
  - host: IP_ADDRESS_CAMERA
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD

```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: >
    The IP address or hostname of your camera.
    If using a hostname, make sure the DNS works as expected.
  required: true
  type: string
username:
  description: The username for accessing your camera.
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: The password for accessing your camera.
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: >
    This parameter allows you to override the name of your camera. In the case of multi-camera setups,
    this is highly recommended as camera id number will be randomly changed at each reboot if a name is not allocated.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: Amcrest Camera
port:
  description: The port that the camera is running on.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 80
resolution:
  description: >
    This parameter allows you to specify the camera resolution.
    For a high resolution (1080/720p), specify the option `high`.
    For VGA resolution (640x480p), specify the option `low`.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: high
stream_source:
  description: >
    The data source for the live stream. `mjpeg` will use the camera's native
    MJPEG stream, whereas `snapshot` will use the camera's snapshot API to
    create a stream from still images. You can also set the `rtsp` option to
    generate the streaming via RTSP protocol.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: snapshot
ffmpeg_arguments:
  description: >
    Extra options to pass to ffmpeg, e.g.,
    image quality or video filter options.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: -pred 1
authentication:
  description: >
    Defines which authentication method to use only when **stream_source**
    is **mjpeg**. Currently, *aiohttp* only support *basic*.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: basic
scan_interval:
  description: Defines the update interval of the sensor in seconds.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 10
binary_sensors:
  description: >
    Conditions to display in the frontend.
    The following conditions can be monitored:
  required: false
  type: list
  default: None
  keys:
    motion_detected:
      description: "Return `on` when a motion is detected, `off` when not."
    online:
      description: "Return `on` when camera is available (i.e., responding to commands), `off` when not."
sensors:
  description: >
    Conditions to display in the frontend.
    The following conditions can be monitored:
  required: false
  type: list
  default: None
  keys:
    sdcard:
      description: Return the SD card usage by reporting the total and used space.
    ptz_preset:
      description: >
        Return the number of PTZ preset positions
        configured for the given camera.
control_light:
  description: >
    Automatically control the camera's indicator light, turning it on if the audio or video streams are enabled, and turning it off if both streams are disabled.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: true
{% endconfiguration %}

**Note:** Amcrest cameras with newer firmware no longer have the ability to
stream `high` definition video with MJPEG encoding. You may need to use `low`
resolution stream or the `snapshot` stream source instead.  If the quality seems
too poor, lower the `Frame Rate (FPS)` and max out the `Bit Rate` settings in
your camera's configuration manager. If you defined the *stream_source* to
**mjpeg**, make sure your camera supports *Basic* HTTP authentication.
Newer Amcrest firmware may not work, then **rtsp** is recommended instead.

**Note:** If you set the `stream_source` option to `rtsp`,
make sure to follow the steps mentioned at [FFMPEG](/integrations/ffmpeg/)
documentation to install the `ffmpeg`.

## Services

Once loaded, the `amcrest` integration will expose services that can be called to perform various actions. The `entity_id` service attribute can specify one or more specific cameras, or `all` can be used to specify all configured Amcrest cameras.

Available services:
`enable_audio`, `disable_audio`,
`enable_motion_recording`, `disable_motion_recording`,
`enable_recording`, `disable_recording`,
`goto_preset`, `set_color_bw`,
`start_tour` and `stop_tour`

#### Service `enable_audio`/`disable_audio`

These services enable or disable the camera's audio stream.

Service data attribute | Optional | Description
-|-|-
`entity_id` | no | Name(s) of entities, e.g., `camera.living_room_camera`.

#### Service `enable_motion_recording`/`disable_motion_recording`

These services enable or disable the camera to record a clip to its configured storage location when motion is detected.

Service data attribute | Optional | Description
-|-|-
`entity_id` | no | Name(s) of entities, e.g., `camera.living_room_camera`.

#### Service `enable_recording`/`disable_recording`

These services enable or disable the camera to continuously record to its configured storage location.

Service data attribute | Optional | Description
-|-|-
`entity_id` | no | Name(s) of entities, e.g., `camera.living_room_camera`.

#### Service `goto_preset`

This service will cause the camera to move to one of the PTZ locations configured within the camera.

Service data attribute | Optional | Description
-|-|-
`entity_id` | no | Name(s) of entities, e.g., `camera.living_room_camera`.
`preset` | no | Preset number, starting from 1.

#### Service `set_color_bw`

This service will set the color mode of the camera.

Service data attribute | Optional | Description
-|-|-
`entity_id` | no | Name(s) of entities, e.g., `camera.living_room_camera`.
`color_bw` | no | One of `auto`, `bw` or `color`.

#### Service `start_tour`/`stop_tour`

These services start or stop the camera's PTZ tour function.

Service data attribute | Optional | Description
-|-|-
`entity_id` | no | Name(s) of entities, e.g., `camera.living_room_camera`.

## Advanced Configuration

You can also use this more advanced configuration example:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
amcrest:
  - host: IP_ADDRESS_CAMERA_1
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
    binary_sensors:
      - motion_detected
      - online
    sensors:
      - sdcard

  # Add second camera
  - host: IP_ADDRESS_CAMERA_2
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
    name: Amcrest Camera 2
    resolution: low
    stream_source: snapshot
    sensors:
      - ptz_preset
```
