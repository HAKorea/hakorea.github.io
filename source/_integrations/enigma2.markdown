The `enigma2` platform allows you to control a Linux based set-top box which is running [Enigma2](https://github.com/oe-alliance/oe-alliance-enigma2) with the OpenWebif plugin installed.

[OpenWebif](https://github.com/E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif) is an open source web interface for Enigma2 based set-top boxes.

Enigma2 devices should be discovered automatically by using the [the discovery component](/integrations/discovery/).

To manually add a set-top box to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: enigma2
    host: IP_ADDRESS
```

{% configuration %}
  host:

    required: false
    type: boolean

  deep_standby:
    description: If set to true, when the user selects Turn Off, the box will go into "deep standby" mode, meaning it can be only awoken by the remote control or via Wake On Lan (if box supports that).

    type: boolean
    default: false
