With the `namecheapdns` integration you can automatically update your dynamic DNS entry at [namecheapdns](https://www.namecheap.com/store/domains/freedns/).

Namecheap only supports IPv4 addresses to update.

## Configuration

To use the integration in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml

```

{% configuration %}
