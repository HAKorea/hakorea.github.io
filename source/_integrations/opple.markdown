The `opple` light platform allows you to control the state of your Opple smart light.

The platform supports all Opple lights with Wi-Fi support or lights that can be controlled by the App.

To use your Opple light in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: opple
    name: LIGHT_NAME
    host: IP_ADDRESS
```

{% configuration %}
name:

  default: opple light
host:
  description: "The IP address of your Opple light, e.g., `192.168.0.21`."
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}
