The `mqtt` cover platform allows you to control an MQTT cover (such as blinds, a rollershutter or a garage door).

## Configuration

The device state (`open` or `closed`) will be updated only after a new message is published on `state_topic` matching `state_open` or `state_closed`. If these messages are published with the `retain` flag set, the cover will receive an instant state update after subscription and Home Assistant will display the correct state on startup. Otherwise, the initial state displayed in Home Assistant will be `unknown`.
`state_topic` can only manage `state_open` and `state_closed`. No percentage positions etc.

For this purpose is `position_topic` which can set state of the cover and position.
Default setting are 0 means the device is `closed` and all other intermediate positions means the device is `open`.
`position_topic` is managed by `position_open` and `position_closed`
You can set it up in opossite way as well.
If position topic is defined than state topic is ignored.

If a state topic and position topic are not defined, the cover will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the cover will immediately change state (`open` or `closed`) after every command sent by Home Assistant. If a state topic/position topic is defined, the cover will wait for a message on `state_topic` or `position_topic`.

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if a `state_topic` / `position_topic` is defined. Try to enable it if experiencing incorrect cover operation (Google Assistant gauge may need optimistic mode as it often send request to your Home Assistant immediately after send set_cover_position in which case MQTT could be too slow).

The `mqtt` cover platform optionally supports an `availability_topic` to receive online and offline messages (birth and LWT messages) from the MQTT cover device. During normal operation, if the MQTT cover device goes offline (i.e. publishes `payload_not_available` to `availability_topic`), Home Assistant will display the cover as "unavailable". If these messages are published with the `retain` flag set, the cover will receive an instant update after subscription and Home Assistant will display correct availability state of the cover when Home Assistant starts up. If the `retain` flag is not set, Home Assistant will display the cover as "unavailable" when Home Assistant starts up.

To use your MQTT cover in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"

## Examples

In this section you will find some real-life examples of how to use this platform.

### Full configuration state topic without tilt

The example below shows a full configuration for a cover without tilt with state topic only.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "MQTT Cover"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"
    state_topic: "home-assistant/cover/state"
    availability_topic: "home-assistant/cover/availability"
    qos: 0
    retain: true
    payload_open: "OPEN"
    payload_close: "CLOSE"
    payload_stop: "STOP"
    state_open: "open"
    state_closed: "closed"
    payload_available: "online"
    payload_not_available: "offline"
    optimistic: false
    value_template: '{{ value.x }}'
```
{% endraw %}

### Full configuration position topic without tilt

The example below shows a full configuration for a cover without tilt with position topic.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "MQTT Cover"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"
    position_topic: "home-assistant/cover/position"
    availability_topic: "home-assistant/cover/availability"
    set_position_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set_position"
    qos: 0
    retain: true
    payload_open: "OPEN"
    payload_close: "CLOSE"
    payload_stop: "STOP"
    position_open: 100
    position_closed: 0
    payload_available: "online"
    payload_not_available: "offline"
    optimistic: false
    value_template: '{{ value.x }}'
```
{% endraw %}

### Full configuration

The example below shows a full configuration for a cover.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "MQTT Cover"
    command_topic: "home-assistant/cover/set"
    state_topic: "home-assistant/cover/state"
    availability_topic: "home-assistant/cover/availability"
    qos: 0
    retain: true
    payload_open: "OPEN"
    payload_close: "CLOSE"
    payload_stop: "STOP"
    state_open: "open"
    state_closed: "closed"
    payload_available: "online"
    payload_not_available: "offline"
    optimistic: false
    value_template: '{{ value.x }}'
    tilt_command_topic: 'home-assistant/cover/tilt'
    tilt_status_topic: 'home-assistant/cover/tilt-state'
    tilt_status_template: '{{ value_json["PWM"]["PWM1"] }}'
    tilt_min: 0
    tilt_max: 180
    tilt_closed_value: 70
    tilt_opened_value: 180
```
{% endraw %}

To test, you can use the command line tool `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` or the `mosquitto-clients` package to send MQTT messages. This allows you to operate your cover manually:

```bash
$  mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/cover/set -m "CLOSE"
```
