The `wunderground` platform uses [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/) as a source for current weather information.

<div class='note warning'>

Obtain a WUnderground API key [here](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api). They no longer offer free API keys, and all keys must be paid for. At this time existing free keys will continue to work, but will be disabled Dec 31, 2018, except you own a personal weather station and provide your data to WU (PWS Uploader). As of Sept 6, 2018 Weather Underground states they are declaring the [End of Service for the Weather Underground API](https://apicommunity.wunderground.com/weatherapi/topics/end-of-service-for-the-weather-underground-api). They say they will develop new plans for non-commercial users. No timeline for this has been announced.

Please consider this when using the following information.

## Forecasts

### 12 hour forecasts

Monitored conditions marked above with <a name="12h">[12h]</a> are 12 hour forecasts. To get a forecast for different period/daytime replace the `_1d_` part of the sensor name.  e.g., `weather_2n` will give you forecast for tomorrow night. Valid values for day are `1` to `4` and valid values for daytime are `d` or `n`.

### Daily forecasts

Conditions above marked with <a name="1d">[1d]</a> are daily forecasts. To get forecast for different day, replace the number
in `_1d_` part of the sensor name. Valid values are from `1` to `4`.

### Hourly forecasts

Conditions marked with <a name="1h">[1h]</a> are hourly forecasts. To get forecast for different hour, replace the number
in the `_1h_` part of the sensor name with `1` to `36`. e.g., `weather_24h` will give you weather in 24 hours.

<div class='note warning'>
Note: While the platform is called “wunderground” the sensors will show up in Home Assistant as “PWS” (eg: sensor.pws_weather).
</div>

Note that the Weather Underground sensor is added to the entity_registry, so second and subsequent Personal Weather Station ID (pws_id) will have their monitored conditions suffixed with an index number e.g.

```yaml
- sensor.pws_weather_1d_metric_2
```

Additional details about the API are available [here](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs).
