[Wink](https://www.wink.com/) is a home automation hub that can control a whole wide range of devices on the market. Or, as they say in their own words:

<blockquote>
  Wink offers one, quick and simple way to connect people with the products they rely on every day in their home.
</blockquote>

Home Assistant integrates with the Wink API and automatically sets up any switches, lights, locks, fans, climate devices (thermostats, air conditioners, and water heaters), covers, sensors, alarms, and sirens.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Alarm](#alarm-control-panel)
- [Binary Sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Climate](#climate)
- [Cover](#cover)
- [Fan](#fan)
- [Light](#light)
- [Lock](#lock)
- Scene
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)
- [Water heater](#water-heater)

## Authenticate using [developer.wink.com](https://developer.wink.com)

You need to set up a developer account with Wink. This process can take a few days to get approved.

Wink requests three pieces of information from the user when they sign up for a developer account.

1. `Name:` This can be anything, for example, "Home Assistant"
2. `Website:` The external address of your Home Assistant instance. If not externally accessible you can use your email address.
3. `Redirect URI:` This should be `http://192.168.1.5:8123/auth/wink/callback` replacing the IP with the internal IP of your Home Assistant box.

No settings are required in the `configuration.yaml` other than `wink:`. 

After adding `wink:` to your `configuration.yaml` and restarting Home Assistant you will see a persistent notification on the frontend with a `CONFIGURE` button that will guide you through the setup via the frontend configurator.

<div class='note'>
When using the configurator make sure the initial setup is performed on the same local network as the Home Assistant server, if not from the same box Home Assistant is running on. This will allow for authentication redirects to happen correctly.
</div>

```yaml
wink:
```

## Full oauth authentication (legacy)

This should be used for users that obtained their client_id and client_secret via email from Wink support prior to [developer.wink.com's](https://developer.wink.com) existence.

```yaml
wink:
  email: YOUR_WINK_EMAIL_ADDRESS
  password: YOUR_WINK_PASSWORD
  client_id: YOUR_WINK_CLIENT_ID
  client_secret: YOUR_WINK_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Please pay attention that the required entries are only needed for legacy OAuth access.

{% configuration %}
email:
  description: Your Wink login email address.
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: Your Wink login password.
  required: true
  type: string
client_id:
  description: Your provided Wink `client_id`.
  required: true
  type: string
client_secret:
  description: Your provided Wink `client_secret`.
  required: true
  type: string
local_control:
  description: If set to `true` state changes for lights, locks and switches will be issued to the local hub.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: false
{% endconfiguration %}

Local control:

- Wink's local control API isn't officially documented and therefore could be broken by a hub update. For these reasons `local_control` defaults to `false`.
- Using local control doesn't appear to make commands any quicker, but does function in an internet/Wink outage.
- Local control is also only available for the Wink hub v1 and v2, not the Wink relay.
- Local control isn't used during the start-up of Home Assistant; this means initial setup requires an active internet connection.
- Local control requests are first sent to the controlling hub. If a request fails, that request will attempt to go online.

<div class='note'>

It is possible for the hub to get into a bad state where it stops accepting local control request. If this happens, you will notice requests taking significantly longer as they are redirected online. This doesn't happen often, but when it does, it appears to be resolved by rebooting the hub.

The following error will be logged if the hub is rejecting local requests.

```txt
Error sending local control request. Sending request online
```

</div>

## Service `refresh_state_from_wink`

The Wink integration only obtains the device states from the Wink API once, during startup. All updates after that are pushed via a third party called PubNub. On rare occasions where an update isn't pushed device states can be out of sync.

You can use the service wink/refresh_state_from_wink to pull the most recent state from the Wink API for all devices. If `local_control` is set to `true` states will be pulled from the devices controlling hub, not the online API.

## Service `pull_newly_added_devices_from_wink`

You can use the service wink/add_new_devices to pull any newly paired Wink devices to an already running instance of Home-Assistant. Any new devices will also be added if Home-Assistant is restarted.

## Service `delete_wink_device`

You can use the service wink/delete_wink_device to remove/unpair a device from Wink.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | no | String that points at the `entity_id` of device to delete.

## Service `pair_new_device`

You can use the service wink/pair_new_device to pair a new device to your Wink hub/relay

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `hub_name` | no | The name of the hub to pair a new device to.
| `pairing_mode` | no | One of the following [zigbee, zwave, zwave_exclusion, zwave_network_rediscovery, lutron, bluetooth, kidde]
| `kidde_radio_code` | conditional | A string of 8 1s and 0s one for each dip switch on the kidde device left --> right = 1 --> 8 (Required if pairing_mode = kidde)

<div class='note'>
Calling service wink/pull_newly_added_wink_devices after a device is paired will add that new device to Home Assistant. The device will also show up on the next restart of Home Assistant.
</div>

## Service `rename_wink_device`

You can use the service wink/rename_wink_device to change the name of a device.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | no | String that points at the `entity_id` of device to rename.
| `name` | no | The name to change it to.

<div class='note'>
Home Assistant entity_ids for Wink devices are based on the Wink device's name. Calling this service will not change the entity_id of the device until Home Assistant is restarted.
</div>

<div class='note'>
The Wink hub, by default, can only be accessed via the cloud. This means it requires an active internet connection and you will experience delays when controlling and updating devices (~3s).
</div>

## Cover

Wink Cover garage door functionality varies on the product. Home Assistant can open, close, and view state of GoControl/Linear openers. For Chamberlain MyQ-enabled openers, Home Assistant is limited to show current state (open or closed) only using this Wink cover. This restriction was imposed by Chamberlain for third party control. Wink suggests that MyQ customers should contact Chamberlain directly to inquire about expanding permissions.

The [MyQ Cover](/integrations/myq) does provide full functionality for opening and closing Chamberlain MyQ-enabled garage doors. If installed along with the Wink Component, a duplicate garage door entity may exist. In that case, the semi-functional Wink garage door entity can be hidden via customize.yaml.
