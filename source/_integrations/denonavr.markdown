The `denonavr` platform allows you to control a [Denon Network Receivers](https://www.denon.co.uk/chg/product/compactsystems/networkmusicsystems/ceolpiccolo) from Home Assistant. It might be that your device is supported by the [Denon] platform.

Supported devices:

- Denon AVR-X1300W
- Denon AVR-X1500H
- Denon AVR-X2000
- Denon AVR-X2100W
- Denon AVR-X4100W
- Denon AVR-X4300H
- Denon AVR-X4500H
- Denon AVR-1912
- Denon AVR-2312CI
- Denon AVR-3311CI
- Denon AVR-4810
- Marantz M-CR510
- Marantz M-CR603
- Marantz M-RC610
- Marantz SR5008
- Marantz SR6007 - SR6010
- Marantz NR1506
- Marantz NR1604
- Other Denon AVR receivers (untested)
- Marantz receivers (experimental)

<div class='note warning'>
If you have something else using the IP controller for your Denon AVR 3808CI, such as your URC controller, it will not work! There is either a bug or security issue with some models where only one device could be controlling the IP functionality.
</div>

To add a Denon Network Receiver to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: denonavr
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    name: NAME
    show_all_sources: true
    timeout: POSITIVE INTEGER
    zones:
      - zone: Zone2 / Zone3
        name: NAME
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: IP address of the device, e.g., 192.168.1.32. If not set, auto-discovery is used.
  required: false
  type: string
name:
  description: Name of the device. If not set, friendlyName of the receiver is used.
  required: false
  type: string
show_all_sources:
  description: If True all sources are displayed in sources list even if they are marked as deleted in the receiver. If False deleted sources are not displayed. Some receivers have a bug that marks all sources as deleted in the interface. In this case, this option could help.
  required: false
  default: false
  type: boolean
timeout:
  description: Timeout in seconds for HTTP requests to the receiver.
  required: false
  default: 2
  type: integer
zones:
  description: List of additional zones to be activated. They are displayed as additional media players with the same functionality Main Zone of the device supports.
  required: false
  type: list
  keys:
    zone:
      description: Zone which should be activated. Valid options are `Zone2` and `Zone3`.
      required: true
      type: string
    name:
      description: Name of the zone. If not set the name of the main device + zone as a suffix is taken.
      required: false
      type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

A few notes:

- An additional option for the control of Denon AVR receivers with a built-in web server is using the HTTP interface with `denonavr` platform.
- The `denonavr` platform supports some additional functionalities like album covers, custom input source names and auto discovery.
- Marantz receivers seem to a have quite a similar interface. Thus if you own one, give it a try.
- To remotely power on Marantz receivers with Home Assistant, the Auto-Standby feature must be enabled in the receiver's settings.
- Sound mode: The command to set a specific sound mode is different from the value of the current sound mode reported by the receiver (sound_mode_raw). There is a key-value structure (sound_mode_dict) that matches the raw sound mode to one of the possible commands to set a sound mode (for instance {'MUSIC':['PLII MUSIC']}. If you get a "Not able to match sound mode" warning, please open an issue on the [denonavr library](https://github.com/scarface-4711/denonavr), stating which raw sound mode could not be matched so it can be added to the matching dictionary. You can find the current raw sound mode under "Development Tools/States" in the front panel.


#### Service `denonavr.get_command`

Generic commands are supported, in particular, any command supported by the telnet protocol can be sent to `/goform/formiPhoneAppDirect.xml`, e.g., `/goform/formiPhoneAppDirect.xml?VSMONI2` to switch HDMI outputs on supported receivers. IR remote codes can also be sent to this endpoint, e.g. "/goform/formiPhoneAppDirect.xml?RCKSK0410370" as a mute toggle. A comprehensive list of telnet protocol commands is available at https://ca.denon.com/ca/product/hometheater/receivers/avrx4400h?docname=AVR-X6400H_X4400H_X3400H_X2400H_X1400H_S930H_S730H_PROTOCOL_V01.xlsx and a full list of IR codes at http://www.denon-hifi.nl/uk/product/hometheater/avreceivers/avr3313?docname=AVR3313_IR_CODE_V01.pdf
