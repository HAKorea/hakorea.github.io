The Elk-M1 is a home security and automation controller that is capable of alarm control panel functions and automation.

The Elk-M1 controller is manufactured by [Elk Products](https://www.elkproducts.com).

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- **Alarm** - An Elk-M1 area (also known as partition) is represented as an `alarm_control_panel`.
- **Climate** - An Elk-M1 thermostat is represented as a `climate` entity.
- **Light** - An Elk-M1 light (which can be X10, Insteon, UPB) is represented as a `light`.
- **Scene** - Elk-M1 tasks are represented as `scene` entities.
- **Sensor** - Elk-M1 counters, keypads, panel, settings, and zones are represented as `sensor` entities.
- **Switch** - Elk-M1 outputs are represented as `switch` entities.

## Configuration

To integrate one or more Elk-M1 controllers with Home Assistant, add the following
section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
elkm1:
  - host: elk://IP_ADDRESS_1
  ...
  - host: elk://IP_ADDRESS_2
    prefix: gh  # for guest house controller
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: Connection string to Elk of the form `<method>://<address>[:port]`. `<method>` is `elk` for non-secure connection, `elks` for secure connection, and `serial` for serial port connection. `<address>` is IP address or domain or for `serial` the serial port that the Elk is connected to. Optional `<port>` is the port to connect to on the Elk, defaulting to 2101 for `elk` and 2601 for `elks`. For `serial` method, _address_ is the path to the tty _/dev/ttyS1_ for example and `[:baud]` is the baud rate to connect with (Elk systems default to 115200 baud, but this can be changed during Elk system configuration).  You may have multiple host sections for connecting multiple controllers.

Example configuration of the above:

```yaml
elkm1:
  host: elks://IP_ADDRESS
  username: USERNAME
  password: PASSWORD
  area:
    exclude: [5-8]
  zone:
    exclude: [11-16, 19-192, 199-208]
  plc:
    include: [a1-d16, 192]
    exclude: [b12-d5]
```

Example for a serial port instance on /dev/ttyUSB0 at 115200 baud:

```yaml
elkm1:
  - host: serial:///dev/ttyUSB0:115200
    # Elk doesn't know which areas/zones/etc are unused, so it can generate
    # many unwanted Home Assistant Entities.  Be liberal in excluding them:
    area:
      exclude: [2-8]
    zone:
      exclude: [17-192, 195-208]
    plc:
      enabled: false
    task:
      enabled: false
    counter:
      exclude: [1-64]
    keypad:
      exclude: [3-16]
    setting:
      exclude: [1-20]
    output:
      enabled: false
    thermostat:
      enabled: false
```
