The `recollect_waste` integration allows you to track the next scheduled waste pickup and what type of waste from [Recollect](https://recollect.net/private-waste-haulers/). To use this sensor your city's waste company must be Recollect and you will need to find your place_id and service_id.

1. In Chrome open developer tools and go to the network tab.
2. Go to your city's Recollect collection calendar.
3. Search for and select your address in the UI.
4. Watch for a request that looks like

   ht<span>tps://api.recollect.net/api/places/**(place_id)**/services/**(service_id)**/events?nomerge ...

5. Use the place_id and service_id when configuring the sensor.

## Configuration

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: recollect_waste
    place_id: YOUR_PLACE_ID

```

{% configuration %}
place_id:
