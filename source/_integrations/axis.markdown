[Axis Communications](https://www.axis.com/) devices are surveillance cameras, speakers, access control and other security-related network connected hardware. Event API works with firmware 5.50 and newer.

Home Assistant will automatically discover their presence on your network.

## Configuration

For configuration go to the `Integrations pane` on your Home Assistant instance.

<div class='note'>
  It is recommended that you create a user on your Axis device specifically for Home Assistant. For all current functionality, it is enough to create a user belonging to user group viewer.
