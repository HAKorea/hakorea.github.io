[Lutron](http://www.lutron.com/) is an American lighting control company. The Lutron Homeworks Series 4 & 8 systems are relatively old (~2003), and use RS-232 connections to communicate with home automation systems.  The `homeworks` integration in Home Assistant is responsible for communicating with the main controller for these systems.  Communication is through an ethernet to serial converter (NPort, for example).

Only a subset of the Homeworks system is supported - lights and keypads.

Lutron has created many systems over the years, each with their own unique interfacing protocol.  There are three Homeworks systems - QS, Series 4 & 8, and original.  This platform is only for Series 4 & 8.  There is another integration [lutron](/integrations/lutron/) which handles Lutron RadioRA 2 systems.

Homeworks keypad buttons are momentary switches.  The button is pressed and released, meaning that there is no "state".  Buttons generate `homeworks_button_press` and `homeworks_button_release` events.  These events contain the "id", "name", and "button" of the button that was pressed.  "id" is derived from "name", and "button" is the number of the button on the keypad (starting at 1).

## Configuration

The protocol for automatically extracting device information from the controller isn't documented, so the `homeworks` integration must be configured manually. To use Lutron Homeworks devices in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

``` yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
homeworks:
  host: IP_ADDRESS
  port: 4001
  dimmers:
    - addr: "[02:08:01:01]"
      name: "Foyer Sconces"
    - addr: "[02:08:01:02]"
      name: "Foyer Downlights"
      rate: 2

  keypads:
    - addr: "[02:08:02:01]"
      name: "Foyer Keypad"
```
