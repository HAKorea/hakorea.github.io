`Traccar` uses GPS for tracking and has support for over 1500 different types of devices. One option is to track the [Traccar Client](https://www.traccar.org/client/) app on a smartphone via `webhook`. The other option is to connect to an existing [Traccar Server](https://www.traccar.org/server/) installation which is also available as Hass.io addon.

## Traccar Client

To configure Traccar Client, you must set it up via the integrations panel in the configuration screen. This will give you the webhook URL to use during mobile device configuration. This URL has to be set in the Traccar app.

## Traccar Server

To integrate Traccar Server in Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: traccar
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    username: USERNAME
    password: PASSWORD

{% endconfiguration %}

The parameter `monitored_conditions` allows you to track non standard attributes from the traccar platform and use them in your Home Assistant. For example if you need to monitor the state of the non standard attribute `alarm` and a custom computed attribute `mycomputedattribute` just fill the configuration with:

```yaml
device_tracker:
  - platform: traccar
    ...
    monitored_conditions: ['alarm', 'mycomputedattribute']
```

The parameter `event` allows you to import events from the traccar platform (https://www.traccar.org/documentation/events/) and fire them in your Home Assistant. It accepts a list of events to be monitored and imported and each event must be listed in lowercase snakecase. The events will be fired with the same event name defined in the abovementioned list preceded by the prefix `traccar_`. For example if you need to import the Traccar events `deviceOverspeed` and `deviceFuelDrop` in Home Assistant, you need to fill the `event` parameter with:

```yaml
device_tracker:
  - platform: traccar
    ...
    event: ['device_overspeed', 'device_fuel_drop']
```
and as soon as Home Assistant receives those events from the platform, they will be fired as `traccar_device_overspeed` and `traccar_device_fuel_drop`.
*NOTE* Specify `all_events` if you want to import all events.
