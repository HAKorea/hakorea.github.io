The `emoncms_history` integration makes it possible to transfer details collected with Home Assistant to [Emoncms.org](https://emoncms.org/) or your local running Emoncms instance. It will send the data to a specific input node on Emoncms with the entity IDs as a key. Afterwards you can create feeds and dashboards in Emoncms with the collected data.

To use the `emoncms_history` integration in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
emoncms_history:
  api_key: YOUR_EMONCMS_WRITE_API_KEY
  url: https://emoncms.org
  inputnode: 19
  whitelist:
    - sensor.owm_temperature
    - sensor.owm_wind_speed
```
