The `config` integration is designed to display panels in the frontend to configure and manage parts of Home Assistant.

This integration is by default enabled, unless you've disabled or removed the [`default_config:`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/default_config/) line from your configuration. If that is the case, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
config:
```

### Integrations
