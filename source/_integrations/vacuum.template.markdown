The `template` platform creates vacuums that combine integrations and provides the
ability to run scripts or invoke services for each of the start, pause, stop,
return_to_base, clean_spot, locate and set_fan_speed commands of a vacuum.

To enable Template Vacuums in your installation, add the following to your
`configuration.yaml` file:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
vacuum:
  - platform: template
    vacuums:
      living_room_vacuum:
        start:
          service: script.vacuum_start
```

{% endraw %}

{% configuration %}

## Examples

### Control vacuum with Harmony Hub

This example shows how you can use a Template Vacuum to control an IR vacuum cleaner using the [Harmony Hub Remote component](/integrations/harmony).

```yaml
vacuum:
  - platform: template
    vacuums:
      living_room_vacuum:
        start:
          - service: remote.send_command
            data:
              entity_id: remote.harmony_hub
              command: Clean
              device: 52840686
        return_to_base:
          - service: remote.send_command
            data:
              entity_id: remote.harmony_hub
              command: Home
              device: 52840686
        clean_spot:
          - service: remote.send_command
            data:
              entity_id: remote.harmony_hub
              command: SpotCleaning
              device: 52840686
```

### Vacuum with state

This example shows how to use templates to specify the state of the vacuum.

{% raw %}

```yaml
vacuum:
  - platform: template
    vacuums:
      living_room_vacuum:
        value_template: "{{ states('sensor.vacuum_state') }}"
        battery_level_template: "{{ states('sensor.vacuum_battery_level')|int }}"
        fan_speed_template: "{{ states('sensor.vacuum_fan_speed') }}"
        start:
            service: script.vacuum_start
        pause:
            service: script.vacuum_pause
        stop:
            service: script.vacuum_stop
        return_to_base:
            service: script.vacuum_return_to_base
        clean_spot:
            service: script.vacuum_clean_spot
        locate:
            service: script.vacuum_locate_vacuum
        set_fan_speed:
            service: script.vacuum_set_fan_speed
            data_template:
              speed: "{{ fan_speed }}"
        fan_speeds:
            - Low
            - Medium
            - High
```

{% endraw %}
