The `darksky` platform uses the [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/) web service as a source for meteorological data for your location. The location is based on the `longitude` and `latitude` coordinates configured in your `configuration.yaml` file. The coordinates are auto-detected but to take advantage of the hyper-local weather reported by Dark Sky, you can refine them down to your exact home address. GPS coordinates can be found by using [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) and clicking on your home or [Openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

## Setup

You need an API key which is free but requires [registration](https://darksky.net/dev/register). You can make up to 1000 calls per day for free which means that you could make one approximately every 86 seconds.

<div class='note warning'>

[Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev/) will charge you $0.0001 per API call if you enter your credit card details and create more than 1000 calls per day.

</div>

## Configuration

To add Dark Sky to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: darksky
    api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
    forecast:
      - 0
    hourly_forecast:
      - 0
