The `influxdb` integration makes it possible to transfer all state changes to an external [InfluxDB](https://influxdb.com/) database. See the [official installation documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/introduction/installation/) for how to set up an InfluxDB database, or if you're using Hass.io, [there is a community add-on](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/community-hass-io-add-on-influxdb/54491) available.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Sensor](#sensor)

<div class='note'>

The `influxdb` database integration runs parallel to the Home Assistant database. It does not replace it.

</div>

## Configuration

The default InfluxDB configuration doesn't enforce authentication. If you have installed InfluxDB on the same host where Home Assistant is running and haven't made any configuration changes, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
influxdb:
```

You will still need to create a database named `home_assistant` via InfluxDB's command line interface. For instructions on how to create a database check the [InfluxDB documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/introduction/getting_started/#creating-a-database) relevant to the version you have installed.

## Sensor

The `influxdb` sensor allows you to use values from an [InfluxDB](https://influxdb.com/) database to populate a sensor state. This can be use to present statistic about home_assistant sensors if used with the `influxdb` history component. It can also be used with an external data source.

To configure this sensor, you need to define the sensor connection variables and a list of queries to  your `configuration.yaml` file. A sensor will be created for each query:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: influxdb
    queries:
      - name: mean value of foo
        where: '"name" = ''foo'''
        measurement: '"째C"'
```

## Examples

### Full configuration

The example configuration entry below create two request to your local InfluxDB instance, one to the database `db1`, the other to `db2`:

- `select last(value) as value from "째C" where "name" = "foo"`
- `select min(tmp) as value from "%" where "entity_id" = ''salon'' and time > now() - 1h`

```yaml
sensor:
  platform: influxdb
  host: localhost
  username: home-assistant
  password: password
  queries:
    - name: last value of foo
      unit_of_measurement: 째C
      value_template: '{% raw %}{{ value | round(1) }}{% endraw %}'
      group_function: last
      where: '"name" = ''foo'''
      measurement: '"째C"'
      field: value
      database: db1
    - name: Min for last hour
      unit_of_measurement: '%'
      value_template: '{% raw %}{{ value | round(1) }}{% endraw %}'
      group_function: min
      where: '"entity_id" = ''salon'' and time > now() - 1h'
      measurement: '"%"'
      field: tmp
      database: db2
```
