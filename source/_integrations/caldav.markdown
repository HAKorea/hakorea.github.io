The `caldav` platform allows you to connect to your WebDav calendar and generate
binary sensors. A different sensor will be created for each individual calendar,
or you can specify custom calendars which match a criteria you define (more on
that below). These sensors will be `on` if you have an on going event in that
calendar or `off` if the event is later in time, or if there is no event at all.
The WebDav calendar get updated roughly every 15 minutes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have a CalDav server and credentials for it. This integration was
tested against [Baikal](http://sabre.io/baikal/) but any integration complying
with the RFC4791 should work. [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)
and [Owncloud](https://owncloud.org/) work fine.

You might need some additional system packages to compile the
Python caldav library. On a Debian based system, install them by:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev
```

### Basic Setup

To integrate a WebDav calendar in Home Assistant,
add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for baikal
calendar:
  - platform: caldav
    username: john.doe@test.com
    password: !secret caldav
    url: https://baikal.my-server.net/cal.php/calendars/john.doe@test.com/default
```

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for nextcloud, calendars will be found automatically
calendar:
  - platform: caldav
    username: john.doe
    password: !secret caldav
    url: https://nextcloud.example.com/remote.php/dav
```

This example will generate default binary sensors for each calendar you have in
your account. Those calendars will be `on` when there is an ongoing event and
`off` if not. Events that last a whole day are ignored in those calendars.
You have to setup custom calendars in order to take them into account or for
advanced event filtering.

### Custom calendars

You have the possibility to create multiple binary
sensors for events that match certain conditions.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
calendar:
  - platform: caldav
    username: john.doe@test.com
    password: !secret caldav
    url: https://baikal.my-server.net/cal.php/calendars/john.doe@test.com/default
    custom_calendars:
      - name: 'HomeOffice'
        calendar: 'Agenda'
        search: 'HomeOffice'
      - name: 'WarmupFlat'
        calendar: 'Agenda'
        search: 'Warmup'
```

This will create two binary sensors for the calendar name Agenda: "HomeOffice"
and "WarmupFlat". Those sensors will be `on` if there is an ongoing event
matching the regular expression specified in `search`.
In custom calendars, events that last a whole day are taken into account.

Please note that when you configure custom calendars,
the default ones are not created anymore.

        Regular expression for filtering the events based on
        the content of their summary, description or location.
      type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

### Sensor attributes

 - **offset_reached**: If set in the event title and parsed out will be on/off once the offset in the title in minutes is reached. So the title Very important meeting !!-10 would trigger this attribute to be on 10 minutes before the event starts.
 - **all_day**: `True/False` if this is an all day event. Will be `False` if there is no event found.
 - **message**: The event title with the `search` values extracted. So in the above example for `offset_reached` the message would be set to Very important meeting
 - **description**: The event description.
 - **location**: The event Location.
 - **start_time**: Start time of event.
 - **end_time**: End time of event.

### Examples

All events of the calendars "private" and "holidays". Note that all day events are not included.
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for nextcloud
calendar:
  - platform: caldav
    url: https://nextcloud.example.com/remote.php/dav
    username: 'me'
    password: !secret caldav
    calendars:
      - private
      - holidays
```

Full example with automation to wake up to music if not holiday.
Prerequisite: you have a calendar named "work" where
you create calendar entries containing "Holiday".

Custom calendar names are built from the
main calendar + name of the custom calendar.

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
calendar:
  - platform: caldav
    url: https://nextcloud.example.com/remote.php/dav
    username: 'me'
    password: !secret caldav
    custom_calendars:
      - name: holiday
        calendar: work
        search: 'Holiday'

# automations.yaml
- id: wakeup
  alias: worktime wakeup
  trigger:
    platform: time
    at: '06:40:00'
  action:
  - service: media_player.media_play
    entity_id: media_player.bedroom
  condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: calendar.work_holiday
    state: 'off'
```
