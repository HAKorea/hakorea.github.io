The `discogs` platform allows you to see the current amount of records in your [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com) collection.

## Setup

First, you'll need to get a personal access token from your Discogs account.
You can generate a token from your profile's [Developer settings](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers).

## Configuration

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: discogs
    token: YOUR_TOKEN
```

The monitored conditions can create a sensor which displays the amount of records currently in your collection and/or wantlist, and an option to pick a random record from your collection.
