The `Brother Printer` integration allows you to read current data from your local Brother printer.

It usually provides information about the device's state, the left amount of ink or toner and the remaining life of the drum or other parts of the printer.
The integration monitors every supported part.

## Configuration

To add `Brother Printer` to your installation, go to **Configuration** >> **Integrations** in the UI, click the button with `+` sign and from the list of integrations select **Brother Printer**.

<div class="note warning">

Some very old Brother printers use different data format and these models are not supported. The integration will show information about that during configuration.
