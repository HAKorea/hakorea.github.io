[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) is a web service that allows users to create chains of simple conditional statements, so-called "Applets". With the IFTTT component, you can trigger applets through the **"Webhooks"** service (which was previously the **"Maker"** channel).

## Sending events from IFTTT to Home Assistant

To be able to receive events from IFTTT, your Home Assistant instance needs to be accessible from the web ([Hass.io instructions](/addons/duckdns/)) and you need to have the `base_url` configured for the HTTP integration ([docs](/integrations/http/#base_url)).

### Setting up the integration

To set it up, go to the integrations page in the configuration screen and find IFTTT. Click on configure. Follow the instructions on the screen to configure IFTTT.

### Using the incoming data

Events coming in from IFTTT will be available as events in Home Assistant and are fired as `ifttt_webhook_received`. The data specified in IFTTT will be available as the event data. You can use this event to trigger automations.

For example, set the body of the IFTTT webhook to:

```json
{ "action": "call_service", "service": "light.turn_on", "entity_id": "light.living_room" }
```

You then need to consume that incoming information with the following automation:

{% raw %}
```yaml
automation:
- id: this_is_the_automation_id
  alias: The optional automation alias
  trigger:
  - event_data:
      action: call_service
    event_type: ifttt_webhook_received
    platform: event
  condition: []
  action:
  - data_template:
      entity_id: '{{ trigger.event.data.entity_id }}'
    service_template: '{{ trigger.event.data.service }}'
```
{% endraw %}

## Sending events to IFTTT

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
ifttt:
  key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

`key` is your API key which can be obtained by viewing the **Settings** of the [Webhooks applet](https://ifttt.com/services/maker_webhooks/settings). It's the last part of the URL (e.g., https://maker.ifttt.com/use/MYAPIKEY) you will find under **My Applets** > **Webhooks** > **Settings**.

Once you have added your key to your `configuration.yaml` file, restart your Home Assistant server. This will load up the IFTTT integration and make a service available to trigger events in IFTTT.

<div class='note'>
After restarting the server, be sure to watch the console for any logging errors that show up in red, white or yellow.
</div>

### Multiple IFTTT keys

If you have multiple IFTTT users you can specify multiple IFTTT keys with:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
ifttt:
  key: 
    YOUR_KEY_NAME1: YOUR_API_KEY1
    YOUR_KEY_NAME2: YOUR_API_KEY2
```


### Testing your trigger

You can use **Developer Tools** to test your [Webhooks](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) trigger. To do this, open the Home Assistant sidebar, click on Developer Tools, and then the **Services** tab. Fill in the following values:

Field | Value
----- | -----
domain | `ifttt`
service | `trigger`
Service Data | `{"event": "EventName", "value1": "Hello World"}`

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/integrations/ifttt/testing_service.png' />
When your screen looks like this, click the 'call service' button.
</p>

By default the trigger is sent to all the api keys from `configuration.yaml`. If you
want to send the trigger to a specific key use the `target` field:

Field | Value
----- | -----
domain | `ifttt`
service | `trigger`
Service Data | `{"event": "EventName", "value1": "Hello World", "target": "YOUR_KEY_NAME1"}`

The `target` field can contain a single key name or a list of key names.

### Setting up a recipe

Press the *New applet* button and search for *Webhooks*.

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/integrations/ifttt/setup_service.png' />
Choose "Webhooks" as service.
</p>

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/integrations/ifttt/setup_trigger.png' />
You need to setup a unique trigger for each event you sent to IFTTT.
</p>

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml Automation entry
automation:
  alias: Startup Notification
  trigger:
    platform: homeassistant
    event: start
  action:
    service: ifttt.trigger
    data: {"event":"TestHA_Trigger", "value1":"Hello World!"}
```
{% endraw %}

IFTTT can also be used in scripts and with `data_template`.  Here is the above automation broken into an automation and script using variables and data_templates.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml Automation entry
automation:
  alias: Startup Notification
  trigger:
    platform: homeassistant
    event: start
  action:
    service: script.ifttt_notify
    data_template:
      value1: 'HA Status:'
      value2: "{{ trigger.event.data.entity_id.split('_')[1] }} is "
      value3: "{{ trigger.event.data.to_state.state }}"
```
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
```yaml
#Example Script to send TestHA_Trigger to IFTTT but with some other data (homeassistant UP).
ifttt_notify:
  sequence:
    - service: ifttt.trigger
      data_template: {"event":"TestHA_Trigger", "value1":"{{ value1 }}", "value2":"{{ value2 }}", "value3":"{{ value3 }}"}
```
{% endraw %}
