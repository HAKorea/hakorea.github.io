The `smhi` integration adds support for the [SMHI.se](https://www.smhi.se/) web service as a source for meteorological data for your location.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Weather

## Configuration

The SMHI weather service is free under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0, international license. Weather data will be pulled once every 30 minutes.

To add SMHI weather forecast to your installation, go to the Integrations page inside the config panel and add a location by providing the longitude and latitude of your location.

If the location is configured in Home Assistant, it will be selected as the default location. After that, you can add additional locations.

You can only add locations through the integrations page, not in configuration files.
