The `dwd_weather_warnings` sensor platform uses the [Deutsche Wetter Dienst (DWD)](https://www.dwd.de) as a source for current and advance warnings.

- A name is optional but if multiple regions are used a name will be required.
- The sensor checks for new data every 15 minutes.

## Configuration

To add the DWD WarnApp sensor to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: dwd_weather_warnings
    region_name: Hansestadt Hamburg
```

<div class="note">

As it suggests the region name is not the city or nearest city you want to get the warnings for but the next higher level of the governmental district called "Kreis" in German.

Be aware, to get the region name you need to use the following link by replacing `Hamburg` with your city:
- Find your region here: `https://www.dwd.de/DE/wetter/warnungen_landkreise/warnWetter_node.html?ort=Hamburg`
- On the page that is loaded in your browser you will find the correct region ("Kreis") below the map as a heading.
- Verify if you find any warning for your region here. Your region ("Kreis") will appear only if warnings exist: `https://www.dwd.de/DWD/warnungen/warnapp_landkreise/json/warnings.json?jsonp=loadWarnings`
