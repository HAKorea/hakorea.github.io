The Huawei LTE router and modem integration for Home Assistant allows you to observe and control [Huawei LTE devices](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/smart-home/).

There is currently support for the following platforms within Home Assistant:

- Presence detection - device tracker for connected devices
- Notifications - via SMS
- Sensors - device, signal, and traffic information
- Switch - mobile data on/off
- Binary sensor - mobile connection status

## Configuration

The integration can be enabled in two ways, either using the frontend
or using YAML. Additionally, if the [SSDP integration](../ssdp/) is
enabled in Home Assistant, automatically discovered Huawei LTE devices
which support and have UPnP enabled are made available for further
optional configuration in the frontend.

The integration can be run with or without
authentication. Authenticated mode enables all available integration
features and entities, but may interfere with accessing the device web
interface from another source such as a browser while the integration
is active or vice versa. The exact list of features requiring
authentication to work varies by device and firmware version. The
integration will try to use all configured ones and fail gracefully if
it detects one requiring authentication in unauthenticated mode.

Only a subset of the entities provided by the target device by
default: 

- WAN IP address sensor
- LTE signal sensors RSRQ, RSRP, RSSI, and SINR
- mobile data switch
- mobile connection binary sensor
- device tracker entries

The rest are added to the entity registry, but disabled by default.

Support for different categories of information and thus available
entities varies by device model and firmware version.

### Configuration via the frontend

Menu: **Configuration** -> **Integrations**.

Click on the `+` sign to add an integration and click on **Huawei
LTE**, and follow the configuration flow. After finishing, the Huawei
LTE integration will be available.

To use unauthenticated mode, leave username and password empty. The
integration will then attempt to first use empty strings to
authenticate and fall back to unauthenticated mode in case that
fails. If this process does not yield desired results, the YAML
configuration (see below) is available for more fine grained control.

Default list of notification recipient phone numbers can be set using
the integration's configuration options.

### Configuration via YAML

To enable the component, add the following lines to your
`configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
huawei_lte:
  - url: http://192.168.100.1/
```
For routers configured via the UI, each configuration item for the
same router in YAML overrides and updates the values set in UI
whenever the YAML configuration values are introduced or updated.

{% configuration %}
url:
  description: URL of the device web interface. Typically http://192.168.100.1/ or http://192.168.1.1/.
  required: true
  type: string
username:
  description: The username used for the device web interface in authenticated mode. Typically `admin`, or empty string (`""`) for USB stick modems. To use unauthenticated mode, leave this variable out altogether.
  required: false
  type: string
password:
  description: The password used for the device web interface in authenticated mode. Typically empty string (`""`) for USB stick modems. To use unauthenticated mode, leave this variable out altogether.
  required: false
  type: string
notify:
  description: Enable notifications using SMS messages. To use notifications, please see the [getting started with automation page](/getting-started/automation/).
  required: false
  type: map
  keys:
    name:
      description: Name of the notification service.
      default: "`huawei_lte`"
      required: false
      type: string
    recipient:
      description: The phone number of a default recipient or a list with multiple recipients.
      required: false
      type: [string, list]
{% endconfiguration %}

## Services

The following router action services are available. When invoked by a user, administrator access is required.

### Service `huawei_lte.clear_traffic_statistics`

Clear traffic statistics.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `url`                  | yes, if only one router configured | Router URL. |

### Service `huawei_lte.reboot`

Reboot router.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `url`                  | yes, if only one router configured | Router URL. |

### Service `huawei_lte.suspend_integration`

Suspend integration. Suspending logs the integration out from the router, and stops accessing it.
Useful e.g. if accessing the router web interface from another source such as a web browser is temporarily required.
Invoke the `huawei_lte.resume_integration` service to resume.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `url`                  | yes, if only one router configured | Router URL. |

### Service `huawei_lte.resume_integration`

Resume suspended integration.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `url`                  | yes, if only one router configured | Router URL. |

## Tested devices

Devices we know to be working with this integration based on the [documentation of used libraries](https://github.com/Salamek/huawei-lte-api/#huawei-lte-api) and reports by users:

- Huawei B310s-22
- Huawei B525s-23a
- Huawei E5186s-22a
- Huawei B618

This is not a complete list. The integration can probably connect to other Huawei LTE devices running similar firmware.
