The `mpchc` platform allows you to connect a [Media Player Classic Home Cinema](https://mpc-hc.org/) to Home Assistant. It will allow you to see the current playing item, and respond to changes in the player's state.

For this integration to function, you will need to enable the Web Interface in the MPC-HC options dialog.

If the server running Home Assistant is not the same device that is running MPC-HC, you will need to ensure that the *allow access from localhost only* option is not set.

<div class='note warning'>

The MPC-HC web interface is highly insecure, and allows remote clients full player control file-system access without authentication. Never allow access to the Web UI from outside of your trusted network, and if possible [use a proxy script to restrict control or redact sensitive information](https://github.com/abcminiuser/mpc-hc-webui-proxy).

To add MPC-HC to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: mpchc
    host: http://192.168.0.123
```

{% configuration %}
host:

  required: true
  type: string
port:

  default: 13579
  type: integer
