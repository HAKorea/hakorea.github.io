The `nuki` platform allows you to control [Nuki Smart Locks](https://nuki.io/en/smart-lock/) via either a [software bridge](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.nuki.bridge) or a [physical bridge](https://nuki.io/en/bridge/).

To add a Nuki bridge to your installation, you need to enable developer mode on your bridge and define a port and an access token. This can be achieved using the [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.nuki). Please note that the API token should be 6-20 characters long, even though the app allows you to set a longer one.
Then add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
lock:
  - platform: nuki
    host: 192.168.1.120
    token: fe2345ef
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The IP or hostname of the Nuki bridge.
  required: true
  type: string
port:
  description: The port on which the Nuki bridge is listening on.
  required: false
  default: 8080
  type: integer
token:
  description: The token that was defined when setting up the bridge.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Services

### Service `lock_n_go`

This will first unlock, wait a few seconds (20 by default) then re-lock. The wait period can be customized through the app.
See the [Nuki Website](https://nuki.io/en/support/smart-lock/sl-features/locking-with-the-smart-lock/) for more details about this feature.
