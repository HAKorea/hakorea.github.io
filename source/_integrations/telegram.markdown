The `telegram` platform uses [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org) to deliver notifications from Home Assistant to your Android device, your Windows phone, or your iOS device.

## Setup

The requirements are:

- You need a [Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots). Please follow those [instructions](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) to create one and get the token for your bot. Keep in mind that bots are not allowed to contact users. You need to make the first contact with your user. Meaning that you need to send a message to the bot from your user.
- You need to configure a [Telegram bot in Home Assistant](/integrations/telegram_chatbot) and define there your API key and the allowed chat ids to interact with.
- The `chat_id` of an allowed user. 

**Method 1:** You can get your `chat_id` by sending any message to the [GetIDs bot](https://t.me/getidsbot).

**Method 2:** To retrieve your `chat_id` you can visit `https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_API_TOKEN/getUpdates` or to use `$ curl -X GET https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_API_TOKEN/getUpdates` **after** you have sent the bot a message. Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with your actual token.

The result set will include your chat ID as `id` in the `chat` section:

```json
{
	"ok": true,
	"result": [{
		"update_id": 254199982,
		"message": {
			"message_id": 27,
			"from": {
				"id": 123456789,
				"first_name": "YOUR_FIRST_NAME YOUR_NICK_NAME",
				"last_name": "YOUR_LAST_NAME",
				"username": "YOUR_NICK_NAME"
			},
			"chat": {
				"id": 123456789,
				"first_name": "YOUR_FIRST_NAME YOUR_NICK_NAME",
				"last_name": "YOUR_LAST_NAME",
				"username": "YOUR_NICK_NAME",
				"type": "private"
			},
			"date": 1678292650,
			"text": "test"
		}
	}]
}
```

**Method 3:** Another way to get your chat ID directly is described below. Start your Python interpreter from the command-line:

```shell
$ python3
>>> import telegram
>>> bot = telegram.Bot(token='YOUR_API_TOKEN')
>>> chat_id = bot.getUpdates()[-1].message.chat_id
>>> print(chat_id)
123456789
```

<div class='note'>
If you want to add new chat IDs then you will need to disable the active configuration to actually see the result with the IDs, otherwise you may only get empty results array.
</div>

## Configuration

To enable Telegram notifications in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for the Telegram Bot
telegram_bot:
  - platform: polling
    api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
    allowed_chat_ids:
      - CHAT_ID_1
      - CHAT_ID_2
      - CHAT_ID_3

# Example configuration.yaml entry for the notifier
notify:
  - name: NOTIFIER_NAME
    platform: telegram
    chat_id: CHAT_ID_2
```

Refer to the platforms mentioned in the
[Telegram chatbot page](/integrations/telegram_chatbot/) for
`telegram_bot` configuration.
