Integrate your [Loop Energy](https://www.your-loop.com/) meter information into Home Assistant. To use this sensor you need the client serial number and secret keys for your devices.

The library used to get the data isn't officially supported and the only way to get the keys is to log into loop energy's website and type a command into your browser console.

To do this log into [Loop Energy](https://www.your-loop.com/). Once you're logged in you should be able see your live readings on the web page.

You can then open your browser's console window, how you do this varies by browser but in Chrome you click on `More Tools / Developer Tools' and click on the console window. You then type:

`Drupal.settings.navetas_realtime.`

This should show something like

```yaml
client_ip: "127.0.0.1"
gas_secret: "GAS_SECRET"
gas_serial: "GAS_SERIAL"
host: "www.your-loop.com"
...
secret: "ELECTRICAL_SECRET"
serial: "ELECTRICAL_SERIAL"
```

The serial and secret tokens are the ones you need. If you just have an electricity monitor then you won't see the gas keys.

Now you have the keys, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`, replacing the `*_SERIAL` and `*_SECRET` keys with the ones you found in the console:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: loopenergy
    electricity:
      electricity_serial: 'ELECTRICAL_SERIAL'
      electricity_secret: 'ELECTRICAL_SECRET'
    gas:
      gas_serial: 'GAS_SERIAL'
      gas_secret: 'GAS_SECRET'
```

{% configuration %}
electricity_serial:
  description: Serial number of your electricity sensor.
  required: true
  type: string
electricity_secret:
  description: Secret key for your electricity sensor.
  required: true
  type: string
gas_serial:
  description: Serial number for your gas sensor.
  required: true
  type: string
gas_secret:
  description: Secret key for your gas sensor.
  required: true
  type: string
gas_type:
  description: Type of meter `imperial` or `metric`.
  required: false
  default: metric
  type: string
gas_calorific:
  description: Calorific value of your gas supply (usually on your gas bill).
  required: false
  default: 39.11
  type: float
{% endconfiguration %}

The electricity readings are updated every 10 seconds and the gas readings every 15 minutes.

The gas readings are experimental and not all gas meters are properly supported. So if the data you see doesn't agree with the readings you see via loop energy please report an issue.
