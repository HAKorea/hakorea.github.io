You can also use `initial_state: 'false'` so that the automation
is not automatically turned on after a Home Assistant reboot.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Door alarm
    initial_state: true
    trigger:
      - platform: state
  ...
```

## Configuration

This integration is by default enabled, unless you've disabled or removed the [`default_config:`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/default_config/) line from your configuration. If that is the case, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
automation:
```
