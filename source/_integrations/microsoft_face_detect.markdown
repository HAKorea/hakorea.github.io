The `microsoft_face_detect` image processing platform allows you to use the
[Microsoft Face Identify](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/)
API through Home Assistant. This platform enables you do detect face on camera
and fire an event with attributes.

Please refer to the [Microsoft Face component](/integrations/microsoft_face/) configuration on
how to setup the API key.

For using the result inside an automation rule,
take a look at the [Image Processing component](/integrations/image_processing/) page.

<div class='note'>

The free version of the Microsoft Face identify API limits the number of requests possible per month. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you limit the `scan_interval` when setting up an instance of this entity as detailed on the main [Image Processing component](/integrations/image_processing/) page.
