This is a FortiGate presence sensor based on device detection of the FortiGate API

## FortiGate set up

Configure the FortiGate with a USERNAME API user and assign its minimum rights profile:

```text
config system accprofile
    edit "homeassistant_profile"
        set authgrp read
    next
end

config system api-user
    edit "USERNAME"
        set api-key API_KEY
        set accprofile "homeassistant_profile"
        set vdom "root"
        config trusthost
            edit 1
                set ipv4-trusthost <trusted subnets>
            next
        end
    next
end
```

## Configuration

Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
