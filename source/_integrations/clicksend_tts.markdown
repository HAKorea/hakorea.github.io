The `clicksend_tts` platform uses [ClickSend](https://clicksend.com) to deliver text-to-speech (TTS) notifications from Home Assistant.

Go to your [ClickSend Dashboard](https://dashboard.clicksend.com) section and create your new project. After creating your project, you should now be able to obtain your `username` and `api_key`.

To add ClickSend to your installation, add the following to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
notify:
  - platform: clicksend_tts
    username: CLICKSEND_USERNAME
    api_key: CLICKSEND_API_KEY
    recipient: PHONE_NO
```
