This `qnap` sensor allows getting various statistics from your [QNAP NAS](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/).

## Configuration

To use the `qnap` sensor in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: qnap
    host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_QNAP_NAS
    username: USERNAME
    password: PASSWORD
    monitored_conditions:
      - status
      - cpu_usage
      - memory_percent_used
      - network_tx
      - volume_percentage_used
```

### Self-signed certificates

If your QNAP device uses self-signed certificates, set the `verify_ssl` option to `false`.

### QNAP device support:

This integration has been tested on the following devices:

- TS-259 Pro+ (QTS 4.2.6)
- TS-410 (QTS 4.2.3)
- TS-419 (QTS 4.2.3)
- TS-451 (QTS 4.2.2)
- TS-470 (QTS 4.2.2)
- TS-639 (QTS 4.2.3)

Other QNAP NAS devices using similar firmware should work fine. For more information about supported devices, or to report issues with your device, please visit the [qnapstats project](https://github.com/colinodell/python-qnapstats#device-support).
