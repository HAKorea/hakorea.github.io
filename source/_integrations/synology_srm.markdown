This platform allows you to detect presence by looking at connected devices to a [Synology SRM](https://www.synology.com/en-us/srm) router.

## Configuration

To use this device tracker in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: synology_srm
    host: 192.168.1.254
    password: YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The Synology SRM router host or IP address, e.g., `192.168.1.1` or `router.mydomain.local`
  required: true
  type: string
port:
  description: The port to connect to the Synology SRM router.
  required: false
  default: 8001
  type: integer
username:
  description: The username of a user with administrative privileges.
  required: false
  default: admin
  type: string
password:
  description: The password for your given admin account.
  required: true
  type: string
ssl:
  description: Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to connect.
  required: false
  default: true
  type: boolean
verify_ssl:

{% endconfiguration %}

It's not possible to create another account in SRM with admin permissions. You'll need to use your admin account (or the one you renamed at creation) for this connection.
