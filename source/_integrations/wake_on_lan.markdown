The `wake_on_lan` integration enables the ability to send _magic packets_ to [Wake on LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN) capable devices to turn them on.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Switch](#switch)

## Configuration

To use this integration in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
wake_on_lan:
```

### Component services

Available services: `send_magic_packet`.

#### Service `wake_on_lan/send_magic_packet`

Send a _magic packet_ to wake up a device with 'Wake-On-LAN' capabilities.

| Service data attribute    | Optional | Description                                           |
|---------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `mac`                     |       no | MAC address of the device to wake up.                 |
| `broadcast_address`       |      yes | Optional broadcast IP where to send the magic packet. |

Sample service data:

```json
{
   "mac":"00:40:13:ed:f1:32"
}
```

## Switch

The `wake_on_lan` (WOL) switch platform allows you to turn on a [WOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN) enabled computer.

### Switch configuration

The WOL switch can only turn on your computer and monitor the state. There is no universal way to turn off a computer remotely. The `turn_off` variable is there to help you call a script when you have figured out how to remotely turn off your computer. See below for suggestions on how to do this.

It's required that the binary `ping` is in your `$PATH`.

To enable this switch in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: wake_on_lan
    mac: MAC_ADDRESS
```

{% configuration %}
mac:
  description: "The MAC address to send the wake up command to, e.g, `00:01:02:03:04:05`."
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: The name of the switch.
  required: false
  default: Wake on LAN
  type: string
host:
  description: The IP address or hostname to check the state of the device (on/off).
  required: false
  type: string
turn_off:
  description: Defines an [action](/getting-started/automation/) to run when the switch is turned off.
  required: false
  type: string
broadcast_address:
  description: The IP address of the host to send the magic packet to.
  required: false
  default: 255.255.255.255
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

### Examples

Here are some real-life examples of how to use the **turn_off** variable.

#### Suspending Linux

Suggested recipe for letting the `turn_off` script suspend a Linux computer (the **target**)
from Home Assistant running on another Linux computer (the **server**).

1. On the **server**, log in as the user account Home Assistant is running under. In this exampleit's `hass`.
2. On the **server**, create SSH keys by running `ssh-keygen`. Just press enter on all questions.
3. On the **target**, create a new account that Home Assistant can ssh into: `sudo adduser hass`. Just press enter on all questions except password. It's recommended using the same user name as on the server. If you do, you can leave out `hass@` in the SSH commands below.
4. On the **server**, transfer your public SSH key by `ssh-copy-id hass@TARGET` where TARGET is your target machine's name or IP address. Enter the password you created in step 3.
5. On the **server**, verify that you can reach your target machine without password by `ssh TARGET`.
6. On the **target**, we need to let the `hass` user execute the program needed to suspend/shut down the target computer. Here is it `pm-suspend`, use `poweroff` to turn off the computer. First, get the full path: `which pm-suspend`. On my system, this is `/usr/sbin/pm-suspend`.
7. On the **target**, using an account with sudo access (typically your main account), `sudo visudo`. Add this line last in the file: `hass ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/pm-suspend`, where you replace `hass` with the name of your user on the target, if different, and `/usr/sbin/pm-suspend` with the command of your choice, if different.
8. On the **server**, add the following to your configuration, replacing TARGET with the target's name:

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: wake_on_lan
    name: "TARGET"
    ...
    turn_off:
      service: shell_command.turn_off_TARGET

shell_command:
  turn_off_TARGET: 'ssh hass@TARGET sudo pm-suspend'
```
