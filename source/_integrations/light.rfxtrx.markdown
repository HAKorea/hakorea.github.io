The `rfxtrx` platform support lights that communicate in the frequency range of 433.92 MHz.

First you have to set up your [rfxtrx hub](/integrations/rfxtrx/).

The easiest way to find your lights is to add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
light:
  - platform: rfxtrx
    automatic_add: true
```

Launch your Home Assistant and go the website. Push your remote and your device should be added:

</p>

Here the name is `0b11000102ef9f210010f70` and you can verify that it works from the frontend. Then you should update your configuration to:

```yaml
light:
  platform: rfxtrx
  devices:
    0b11000102ef9f210010f70:
      name: device_name
```

Example configuration:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  platform: rfxtrx
  devices:
    0b11000f10e9e5660b010f70:
      name: Light1
    0b1100100f29e5660c010f70:
      name: Light_TV
```

signal_repetitions:
  description: Because the RFXtrx device sends its actions via radio and from most receivers it's impossible to know if the signal was received or not. Therefore you can configure the switch to try to send each signal repeatedly.
  required: false

{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note warning'>
If a device ID consists of only numbers, please make sure to surround it with quotes.
This is a known limitation in YAML, because the device ID will be interpreted as a number otherwise.
