The `bom` weather platform uses the [Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)](http://www.bom.gov.au) as a source for current (half-hourly) meteorological data.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Camera](#camera)
- [Sensor](#sensor)

## Configuration

To add the BOM weather platform to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
weather:
  - platform: bom
```

{% configuration %}
name:
  description:  The name you would like to give to the weather station.
  required: false
  type: string
station:
  description: "The station ID string. See the [`sensor.bom` docs](#sensor) for details on how to find the ID of a station."
  required: false
  type: string
  default: The closest station
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note'>

This platform is an alternative to the [`bom`](#sensor) sensor.
The weather platform is easier to configure but less customizable.

</div>

## Camera

The `bom` camera platform uses the [Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)](http://www.bom.gov.au) [radar web service](http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/radar/) as a source to generate an animated radar image.

To add the BOM camera to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
camera:
  - platform: bom
    location: YOUR_LOCATION
```

See below for a list of valid `location` values, and subsitute one for `YOUR_LOCATION`.

{% configuration %}
location:
  description: Required unless `id` is specified. See below for a list of valid locations.
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: Allows you to override the Home Assistant-generated camera name.
  required: false
  type: string
id:
  description: Allows you to manually specify a BOM Radar ID (either `location` or `id` must be defined, but not both).
  required: false
  type: integer
delta:
  description: Time in seconds between BOM radar images available for this radar. Optional if `location` is defined; required if `id` is defined.
  required: false
  type: integer
frames:
  description: Number of frames in the animated GIF. Optional if `location` is defined; required if `id` is defined.
  required: false
  type: integer
filename:
  description: Periodically save the animated GIF image to this filesystem path.
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

### Examples

#### Using `location` and `name`

Example `configuration.yaml` entry to display the `Townsville` radar with a camera named `mytowsvilleradar`:

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: bom
    name: mytownsvilleradar
    location: Townsville
```

#### Using `id`, `delta` and `frames`

In the event BOM creates a new radar, or a radar's ID changes, you may define a custom `id` along with corresponding `delta` and `frames` values. You may also specify custom `delta` and `frames` values, along with a valid `location`, to override the default values for an existing radar. You may not define `location` and `id` in the same entity; you must specify one or the other. If `id` is specified, then `delta` and `frames` values _must_ be provided. If `location` is specified, `delta` and `frames` _may_ be provided to override the default values.

To find a live radar ID (e.g. for the `Townsville` radar), visit the [BOM website's radars page](http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/radar/), click the link for the radar you are interested in, and note the URL, for example: `http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR733.loop.shtml`. The ID is the number following `IDR` (i.e. `733`) in the URL. You can also see, at the bottom of the radar image, a rotating set of times corresponding to the frames of the BOM's JavaScript-driven animation. The number of minutes (in seconds) between these times corresponds to the camera's `delta` value, and the number of frames corresponds to the `frames` value. At the time of this writing, the `Townsville` radar loop is composed of 4 frames at 10-minute (600 second) intervals. Since these are also the default values, this configuration block

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: bom
    location: Townsville
```

is equivalent to this one

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: bom
    id: '053'
    delta: 600
    frames: 4
    name: 'Carnarvon'
```

#### Using `filename`

This option can be specified to save the animated radar-imagery GIF to the given filesystem path.

Example `configuration.yaml` entry to display the `Sydney` radar and save the animated GIF to a file named `sydneyradar.gif` to the filesystem path accessible as `/local/sydneyradar.gif` via Home Assistant's web server:

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: bom
    id: Sydney
    filename: /config/www/images/sydneyradar.gif
```

The file will be updated every `delta` seconds when the camera regenerates the animation.

## Sensor

The `bom` sensor platform uses the [Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)](http://www.bom.gov.au) as a source for current (half-hourly) meteorological data.

- Each sensor will be given the `device_id` of "bom [optionalname] friendlyname units"
- A name is optional but if multiple BOM weather stations are used a name will be required.
- The sensor checks for new data every minute, starting 30 minutes after the timestamp of the most recent data as the data is updated every half-hour.

To add the BOM weather observation to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: bom
    monitored_conditions:
      - apparent_t
      - cloud
      - cloud_base_m
      - cloud_oktas
      - cloud_type_id
      - cloud_type
      - delta_t
      - gust_kmh
      - gust_kt
      - air_temp
      - dewpt
      - local_date_time
      - local_date_time_full
      - press
      - press_qnh
      - press_msl
      - press_tend
      - rain_trace
      - rel_hum
      - sea_state
      - swell_dir_worded
      - swell_height
      - swell_period
      - vis_km
      - weather
      - wind_dir
      - wind_spd_kmh
      - wind_spd_kt
```

To get the station ID for any BOM station:
- Find your station on these maps: [NSW](http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/observations/map.shtml), [QLD](http://www.bom.gov.au/qld/observations/map.shtml), [VIC](http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/observations/map.shtml), [WA](http://www.bom.gov.au/wa/observations/map.shtml), [SA](http://www.bom.gov.au/sa/observations/map.shtml), [TAS](http://www.bom.gov.au/tas/observations/map.shtml), [ACT](http://www.bom.gov.au/act/observations/canberramap.shtml), [NT](http://www.bom.gov.au/nt/observations/map.shtml).
 - alternatively, from the [BOM website](http://www.bom.gov.au/), navigate to State -> Observations -> Latest Observations -> Choose the station.
- The URL will look like `http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDx60801/[station].shtml`
- For Adelaide, the URL will look like `http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDS60801/IDS60801.94675.shtml`; the station ID is `IDS60801.94675`.
