The `epson` platform allows you to control a Epson projector from Home
Assistant.

To add Epson to your installation,
add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: epson
    host: 192.168.0.123
```

{% configuration %}

{% endconfiguration %}
