The `horizon` integration allows you to control a [Unitymedia](https://www.unitymedia.de) Horizon HD Recorder from Home Assistant.

To add a Horizon HD Recorder to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: horizon
    host: 192.168.0.127
```

{% configuration %}
  host:
    description: The hostname or address of the device.
    required: true
    type: string
  port:
    description: The port of the device to connect to.
    required: false
    type: integer
  name:
    description: The name of the device used in the frontend.
    required: false
    type: string
{% endconfiguration %}


#### Preparation of the Horizon HD Recorder

The Home Networking ("Heimnetzwerk") service needs to be enabled at the settings menu of the Horizon receiver. Once you have set up the Media Library ("Medienbibliothek"), we can determine whether the device is turned on or off. Without this, the integration will fail to start.
