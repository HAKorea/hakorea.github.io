<div class='note'>

The `knx` integration must be configured correctly to use this integration, see [KNX Integration](/integrations/knx).

</div>

The `knx` cover platform is used as an interface to KNX covers.

To use your KNX covers in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: knx
    name: "Kitchen.Shutter"
    move_long_address: '3/0/0'
    move_short_address: '3/0/1'
    position_address: '3/0/3'
    position_state_address: '3/0/2'
    travelling_time_down: 51
    travelling_time_up: 61
```
