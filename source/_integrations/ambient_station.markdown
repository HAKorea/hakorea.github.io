The `Ambient Weather Station` integration retrieves local weather information
via personal weather stations from [Ambient Weather](https://ambientweather.net).

## Setup

Using this integration requires both an Application Key and an API Key. To
generate both, simply utilize the profile section of
[your Ambient Weather dashboard](https://dashboard.ambientweather.net).

## Configuration

To add your Ambient Weather PWS to your Home Assistant installation, add the
following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
ambient_station:
  api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
  app_key: YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY
```

{% configuration %}
api_key:
  description: The API key to access the service.
  required: true
  type: string
app_key:
  description: The Application key to access the service.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}
