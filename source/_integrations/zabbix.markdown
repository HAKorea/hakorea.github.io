The `zabbix` integration is the main integration to connect to a [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/) monitoring instance via the Zabbix API.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Sensor](#sensor)

## Configuration

To set the Zabbix integration up, add the following information to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
zabbix:
  host: IP_ADDRESS
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: Your Zabbix server.
  required: true
  type: string
path:
  description: Path to your Zabbix install.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "`/zabbix/`"

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry

## Sensor

The `zabbix` sensor platform let you monitor the current count of active triggers for your [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/) monitoring instance.

<div class='note'>

</div>

To set it up, add the following information to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: zabbix
    triggers:
      name: Important Hosts Trigger Count
      hostids: [10051,10081,10084]
      individual: true
```

{% configuration %}
triggers:
  description: Specifies that this sensor is for Zabbix 'triggers'. In the future there will be other Zabbix sensors.
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: Allows you to specify the name for the Sensor, otherwise the host name, as stored in Zabbix, is used. This is useful when you are specifying a list of hostids to monitor as a single count.
  required: false
  type: string
hostids:
  description: This is a list of Zabbix hostids that we want to filter our count on.
  required: false
  type: string
individual:
  description: A 'true'/'false' to specify whether we should show individual sensors when a list of hostids is provided. If false, the sensor state will be the count of all triggers for the specified hosts (or all hosts within the Zabbix instance, if hostids isn't provided).
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: false
{% endconfiguration %}
