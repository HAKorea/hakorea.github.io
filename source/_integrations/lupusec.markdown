The `lupusec` integration allows the user to integrate their Lupusec alarm control panel and ultimately all connected sensors and other devices. For more information about the LUPUS-Electronics security system please visit their [website](https://www.lupus-electronics.de).

Supported units:

- Lupusec XT1

The following devices are supported by the underlying `lupupy` Python library and integrated into Home Assistant.

- **Alarm Control Panel**: Displays the alarm status and controls arming, disarming and home modus.
- **Binary Sensor**: Displays the status of binary sensors. Currently only Door and window sensors are supported.
- **Switch**: Turn off and on your Lupus power switches.

## Configuration

To use Lupusec devices in your installation, add the following `lupusec` section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
