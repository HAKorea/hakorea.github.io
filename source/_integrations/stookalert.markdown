The `stookalert` sensor platform queries the [RIVM stookalert](https://www.rivm.nl/stookalert) API for unfavorable weather conditions or poor air quality. With a Stookalert, the RIVM calls on people not to burn wood. This can prevent health problems in people in the area.


## Configuration

To enable the platform, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: stookalert
    province: YOUR_NL_PROVINCE
```

{% configuration %}
