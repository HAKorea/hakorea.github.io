The `essent` platform uses [PyEssent](https://github.com/TheLastProject/PyEssent/) to communicate with the (undocumented) API of Dutch energy provider Essent. It provides sensors for each of your meters and tariffs, updated daily.

To add Essent to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: essent
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
