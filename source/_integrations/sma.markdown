The `sma` sensor will poll a [SMA](http://www.sma-solar.com/) [(US)](https://www.sma-america.com/) solar inverter and present the values as sensors (or attributes of sensors) in Home Assistant.

This sensor uses the web interface and to use it, you have to be able to connect to the solar inverter from your favorite web browser.

## Configuration

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry (http)
sensor:
  - platform: sma
    host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE
    password: YOUR_SMA_PASSWORD
    sensors:
      - current_consumption
      - total_consumption
      - pv_power
      - total_yield

# Example configuration.yaml entry (https)
sensor:
  - platform: sma
    host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE
    ssl: true
    verify_ssl: false
    password: YOUR_SMA_PASSWORD
    sensors:
      - current_consumption
      - total_consumption
      - pv_power
      - total_yield
```

{% configuration %}
host:

  required: true
  type: string
ssl:
  description: Enables HTTPS if set to `true`, otherwise with `false` the platform run with HTTP.

## Sensors

Sensors available in the library:

| name         | Unit | Description   |
|--------------|------|:-------------------------------------------|
| pv_power     | W    | Current power generated by the inverter.   |
| pv_gen_meter | kWh  | Total kWh generated to date.               |
| total_yield  | kWh  | Total power yield from a solar installation. |
| daily_yield  | Wh   | The solar plant's yield for today.         !
| current_consumption | W | Power that you are currently drawing, depending on your installation it can be a combination of the inverter and the grid. |
| total_consumption | kWh | Total power consumption. |
| grid_power_supplied | W | Power supplied. |
| grid_power_absorbed | W | Power absorbed. |
| grid_total_yield | kWh | Total power from the grid. |
| grid_total_absorbed | Wh | Total power supplied to the grid
| grid_power | W | Power supplied by the grid. |
| frequency  | Hz | Grid frequency. |
| voltage_l1 | V | Voltage for phase 1. |
| voltage_l2 | V | Voltage for phase 2. |
| voltage_l2 | V | Voltage for phase 3. |
| status     |  | Status of the solar plant. |

The SMA WebConnect module supports a wide variety of sensors, and not all these have been mapped in the `pysma` library. Custom sensors can be defined by using the `custom` section of the configuration. You will need: A sensor name (no spaces), the SMA sensor key and the unit.

Example:

```yaml
   custom:
      yesterday_consumption:
         key: '6400_00543A01'
         unit: kWh
         factor: 1000
```

Over time more sensors will be added as standard sensors to the [pysma library](https://github.com/kellerza/pysma/blob/master/pysma/__init__.py#L100). Feel free to submit additional sensors on that repository.
