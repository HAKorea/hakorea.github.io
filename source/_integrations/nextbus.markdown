The `nextbus` sensor will give you the next departure time and associated data from your public transit station/stop. The data comes from [NextBus](https://www.nextbus.com), which provides real time transit data for a number of transit authorities.

It is possible to get the tag information from the NextBus website.

  1. Visit https://www.nextbus.com/
  2. Use the drop downs to select the transit system, route, direction, and stop
  3. Extract the tags from the URL. It is constructed with the following pattern:

    https://www.nextbus.com/#!/<agency>/<route>/<direction>/<stop>

If tags are incorrect, valid ones will be displayed in the logs as a
convenience.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: nextbus
    agency: AGENCY_TAG
    route: ROUTE_TAG
    stop: STOP_TAG
```
