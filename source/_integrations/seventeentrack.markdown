The `seventeentrack` sensor platform allows users to get package data tied to their [17track.net](https://www.17track.net/en) account. The platform creates both summary sensors, which show the number of packages in a current state (e.g., "In Transit"), as well as individual sensors for each package within the account.

<div class='note warning'>

Although the 17track.net website states that account passwords cannot be longer than 16 characters, users can technically set long-than-16-character passwords. These passwords **will not** work with the used API. Therefore, please ensure that your 17track.net password does not exceed 16 characters.

file:

```yaml
