The `eq3btsmart` climate platform allows you to integrate EQ3 Bluetooth Smart Thermostats.

The current functionality allows setting the temperature as well as controlling the supported modes with help of [python-eq3bt](https://github.com/rytilahti/python-eq3bt) library.
As the device doesn't contain a temperature sensor ([read more](https://forum.fhem.de/index.php/topic,39308.15.html)),
we report target temperature also as current one.

### Testing the connectivity

Before configuring Home Assistant you should check that connectivity with the thermostat is working, which can be done with the eq3cli tool:

```bash
eq3cli --mac 00:11:22:33:44:55

[00:1A:22:XX:XX:XX] Target 17.0 (mode: auto dst, away: no)
Locked: False
Batter low: False
Window open: False
Boost: False
Current target temp: 21.0
Current mode: auto dst
Valve: 0
```

### Configuration

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
climate:
  - platform: eq3btsmart
    devices:
      room1:
        mac: '00:11:22:33:44:55'
```
