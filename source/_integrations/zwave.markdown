The [Z-Wave](https://www.z-wave.com/) integration for Home Assistant allows you to observe and control connected Z-Wave devices. Please see the [Z-Wave getting started section](/docs/z-wave/) for in-depth documentation on how to use and setup the Z-Wave component.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor
- [Climate](#climate)
- [Cover](#cover)
- Fan
- Light
- [Lock](#lock)
- Sensor
- Switch

## Configuration

If you have setup the requirements, then add the following entry `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
zwave:
```

## Climate

To get your Z-Wave thermostat or HVAC unit working with Home Assistant, follow the instructions for the general [Z-Wave component](/getting-started/z-wave/).

<div class='note'>

Thermostats with support for fan modes or different operating modes, will be handled like a HVAC device and will also be detected as one.

If the thermostat supports different operating modes, you will get one thermostat entity for each mode. These can be hidden with settings using the customize setting in the `configuration.yaml` file.

</div>

To enable the climate integration for your Z-Wave network, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file.

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: zwave
```

Once enabled, any Z-Wave climate devices will be available to Home Assistant. Multiple entities may be created. The following entities are created for a Remotec ZXT-120.

- `climate.remotec_zxt120_heating_1_id`: Allows you to control the connected device. See below for examples.
- `sensor.remotec_zxt120_temperature_38`: A sensor which returns the current temperature set on the attached device.

### Automating Z-Wave Climate Devices

The following examples will instruct a Remotec ZXT-120 to turn the attached device mode to Heating, and set the temperature at 24 degrees after 8pm. Add it to `automation.yaml`.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Turn on Heater at 8pm
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "20:00:00"
    action:
      - service: climate.set_hvac_mode
        data:
          entity_id: climate.remotec_zxt120_heating_1_id
          hvac_mode: Heat
      - service: climate.set_temperature
        data:
          entity_id: climate.remotec_zxt120_heating_1_39
          temperature: 24
```

Generally, in Home Assistant, you can use the `homeassistant/turn_off` service to turn devices off. For the Remotec ZXT-120, you must instead make a service call like the following.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Turn off Heater at 9pm
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "21:00:00"
    action:
      - service: climate.set_hvac_mode
        data:
          entity_id: climate.remotec_zxt120_heating_1_id
          hvac_mode: 'Off'
```

**Note:** In the example above, the word `Off` is encased in single quotes to be valid YAML.

### Test if it works

A simple way to test if your Z-Wave climate device is working is to use <img src='/images/screenshots/developer-tool-services-icon.png' alt='service developer tool icon' class="no-shadow" height="38" /> **Services** from the **Developer Tools**. Choose the applicable Climate service from the list of **Available services:** and enter something like the sample below into the **Service Data** field and then press **CALL SERVICE**.

```json
{
  "entity_id": "climate.remotec_zxt120_heating_1_id",
  "hvac_mode": "Heat"
}
```

## Cover

Z-Wave garage doors, blinds, and roller shutters are supported as cover in Home Assistant.

To get your Z-Wave covers working with Home Assistant, follow the instructions for the general [Z-Wave component](#configuration).

If you discover that you need to [invert the operation](/docs/z-wave/installation/#invert_openclose_buttons) of open/close for a particular device, you may change this behavior in your Z-Wave section of your `configuration.yaml` file as follows, in addition you can also [invert percent position](/docs/z-wave/installation/#invert_percent):

```yaml
zwave:
  device_config:
    cover.my_cover:
      invert_openclose_buttons: true
      invert_percent: true
```

## Lock

To get your Z-Wave locks working with Home Assistant, follow the instructions for the general [Z-Wave component](#configuration).

Z-Wave locks will expose three services under the lock domain to manage usercodes if the lock supports it:

| Service | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| clear_usercode | Clears a usercode at code_slot X. Valid code_slots are 1-254, but max is defined by the lock. |
| get_usercode | Get a usercode from the lock at code_slot. Valid code_slots are 1-254, but max is defined by the lock. |
| set_usercode | Sets usercode to X at code_slot Y. Valid usercodes are at least 4 digits, and max defined by the lock. |
