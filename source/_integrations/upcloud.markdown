The `upcloud` integration allows you to access the information about your [UpCloud](https://upcloud.com/) servers from Home Assistant.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary Sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)

## Setup

Set up your API user credentials in your [UpCloud control panel](https://hub.upcloud.com/).

## Configuration

To integrate your UpCloud servers with Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
upcloud:
  username: YOUR_API_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_API_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
username:
  description: Your UpCloud API username.
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: Your UpCloud API user password.
  required: true
  type: string
scan_interval:
  description: Update interval in seconds.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 60
{% endconfiguration %}

## Binary Sensor

The `upcloud` binary sensor platform allows you to monitor your UpCloud servers.

To use your UpCloud servers, you first have to set up your [UpCloud hub](#configuration) and then add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: upcloud
    servers:
      - 002167b7-4cb1-44b7-869f-e0900ddeeae1

```

{% configuration %}
servers:

  required: true
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

## Switch

The `upcloud` switch platform allows you to control (start/stop) your UpCloud servers.

To use your UpCloud servers, you first have to set up your [UpCloud hub](#configuration) and then add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: upcloud
    servers:
      - 002167b7-4cb1-44b7-869f-e0900ddeeae1
