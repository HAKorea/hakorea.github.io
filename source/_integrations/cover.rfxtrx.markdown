The `rfxtrx` platform supports Siemens/LightwaveRF and RFY roller shutters that communicate in the frequency range of 433.92 MHz.

First you have to set up your [rfxtrx hub](/integrations/rfxtrx/).

### Configuration

##### Siemens/LightwaveRF

The easiest way to find your roller shutters is to add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
cover:
  - platform: rfxtrx
    automatic_add: true
```

Launch your homeassistant and go the website (e.g `http://localhost:8123`). Push your remote and your device should be added.

Once added it will show an ID (e.g `0b11000102ef9f210010f70`) and you can verify that it works from the frontend. Then you should update your configuration to:

```yaml
cover:
  - platform: rfxtrx
    devices:
      0b11000102ef9f210010f70:
        name: device_name
```

##### RFY

The [RFXtrx433e](http://www.rfxcom.com/RFXtrx433E-USB-43392MHz-Transceiver/en) is required for RFY support, however it does not support receive for the RFY protocol - as such devices cannot be automatically added. Instead, configure the device in the [rfxmngr](http://www.rfxcom.com/downloads.htm) tool. Make a note of the assigned ID and Unit Code and then add a device to the configuration with the following id `071a0000[id][unit_code]`. E.g., if the id was `0a` `00` `01`, and the unit code was `01` then the fully qualified id would be `071a00000a000101`, if you set your id/code to single digit in the rfxmngr, e.g., id: `1` `02` `04` and unit code: `1` you will need to add `0` before, so `102031` becomes `071a000001020301`.

##### Common

Example configuration:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: rfxtrx
    automatic_add: false
    signal_repetitions: 2
    devices:
      0b1100ce3213c7f210010f70: # Siemens/LightwaveRF
        name: Bedroom Shutter
      071a00000a000101: # RFY
        name: Bathroom Shutter
```

If a device ID consists of only numbers, please make sure to surround it with quotes.
This is a known limitation in YAML, because the device ID will be interpreted as a number otherwise.
