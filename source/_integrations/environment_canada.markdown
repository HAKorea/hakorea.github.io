The `environment_canada` weather platforms provide meteorological data for Canadian locations from [Environment Canada](https://weather.gc.ca/index_e.html).

The following device types and data are supported:

- [Location Selection](#location-selection)
- [Weather](#weather)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
  - [Alert TTS Script](#alert-tts-script)
- [Camera](#camera)

<p class='note'>

  On Raspbian you may need to manually install additional prerequisites with the following command:
  `sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev libopenjp2-7`

</p>

## Location Selection

Each platform automatically determines which weather station's data to use. However, as station coordinates provided by Environment Canada are somewhat imprecise, in some cases you may need to override the automatic selection to use the desired station.

For each platform, the location to use is determined according to the following hierarchy:

  - Location ID specified in platform configuration (optional)
  - Closest station to latitude/longitude specified in platform configuration (optional
  - Closest station to latitude/longitude specified in Home Assistant core configuration

## Weather

The `environment_canada` weather platform populates a weather card with Environment Canada current conditions and forecast [data](https://weather.gc.ca/canada_e.html).

To add Environment Canada weather to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
weather:
  - platform: environment_canada
```

- The platform checks for new data every 10 minutes, and the source data is typically updated hourly within 10 minutes after the hour.
- If no name is given, the weather entity will be named `weather.<station_name>`.
- The platform automatically determines which weather station to use based on the system's latitude/longitude settings. For greater precision, it is also possible to specify either:
    - A specific station code of the form `AB/s0000123` based on those listed in [this CSV file](http://dd.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/citypage_weather/docs/site_list_towns_en.csv), or
    - A specific latitude/longitude

{% endconfiguration %}

## Sensor

The `environment_canada` sensor platform creates sensors based on Environment Canada [current conditions](https://weather.gc.ca/canada_e.html) and [alerts](https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/index_e.html).

To add Environment Canada sensors to your installation, add the desired lines from the following example to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: environment_canada
```

- A sensor will be created for each of the following conditions, with a default name like `sensor.temperature`:     
    - `temperature` - The current temperature, in ºC.
    - `dewpoint` - The current dewpoint, in ºC.
    - `wind_chill` - The current wind chill, in ºC.
    - `humidex` - The current humidex, in ºC.
    - `pressure` - The current air pressure, in kPa.
    - `tendency` - The current air pressure tendency, e.g. "Rising".
    - `humidity` - The current humidity, in %.
    - `visibility` - The current visibility, in km.
    - `condition` - A brief text statement of the current weather conditions, e.g. "Sunny".
    - `icon_code` - A two-digit number corresponding to a condition icon, as specified in these [image to description](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/citypage_weather/docs/Current_Conditions_Icons-Icones_conditions_actuelles.pdf) and [code to description](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/citypage_weather/docs/current_conditions_icon_code_descriptions_e.csv) mappings.
    - `wind_speed` - The current sustained wind speed, in km/h.
    - `wind_gust` - The current wind gust, in km/h.
    - `wind_dir` - The current cardinal wind direction, e.g. "SSW".
    - `wind_bearing` - The current wind direction in degrees.
    - `high_temp` - The next forecast high temperature, in ºC.
    - `low_temp` - The next forecast low temperature, in ºC.
    - `uv_index` - The next forecast UV index.
    - `pop` - The next forecast probability of precipitation, in %.
    - `text_summary` - A textual description of the next forecast period, e.g. "Tonight. Mainly cloudy. Low -12."
    - `precip_yesterday` - The total amount of precipitation that fell the previous day.
    - `warnings` - Current warning alerts.
    - `watches` - Current watch alerts.
    - `advisories` - Current advisory alerts.
    - `statements` - Current special weather statements.
    - `endings` - Alerts that have recently ended.
- The platform automatically determines which weather station to use based on the system's latitude/longitude settings. For greater precision, it is also possible to specify either:
    - A specific station code of the form `AB/s0000123` based on those listed in [this CSV file](http://dd.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/citypage_weather/docs/site_list_towns_en.csv), or
    - A specific latitude/longitude
- In the case of multiple alerts in the same category, the titles and details of each are concatenated together with a pipe (`|`) separator.

### Alert TTS Script

If you would like to have alerts announced via a text-to-speech service, you can use a script similar to the following:

{% raw %}
```yaml
weather_alert_tts:
  sequence:
   - service: tts.amazon_polly_say
      data_template:
        message: "{{ states('sensor.warnings') }} in effect. {{ state_attr('sensor.warnings', 'alert detail') }}"
```
{% endraw %}

## Camera

The `environment_canada` camera platform displays Environment Canada meteorological [radar imagery](https://weather.gc.ca/radar/index_e.html).

To add Environment Canada radar imagery to your installation, add the desired lines from the following example to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
camera:
  - platform: environment_canada
```

<p class='note'>
  On Raspbian you may need to manually install additional prerequisites with the following command:
  `sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev libopenjp2-7`
</p>

- If no name is given, the camera entity will be named `camera.<station_name>_radar`.
- The platform automatically determines which radar station to use based on the system's latitude/longitude settings. For greater precision, it is also possible to specify either:
    - A specific station ID from [this table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_weather_radar_network#List_of_radars). The code must be in the form `XXX` or `CXXXX`, i.e., remove the leading `C` only if the result forms a three-letter code, otherwise, include it. Valid values include `XFT` for Ottawa or `CASBV` for Montreal.
    - A specific latitude/longitude
