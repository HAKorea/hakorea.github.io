The `rpi_rf` switch platform allows you to control devices over 433/315MHz LPD/SRD signals with generic low-cost GPIO RF modules on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

Interoperable with codes sniffed via [the rpi-rf module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rpi-rf) or [rc-switch](https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch).
For more info see the PyPi module description: [rpi-rf](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rpi-rf).

## Configuration

To enable, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: rpi_rf
    gpio: 17
    switches:
      bedroom_light:
        code_on: 1234567
        code_off: 1234568
      ambilight:
        pulselength: 200
        code_on: 987654
        code_off: 133742
      living_room_light:
        protocol: 5
        code_on: 654321,565874,233555,149874
        code_off: 654320,565873,233554,149873
        signal_repetitions: 15
```
