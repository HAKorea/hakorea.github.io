The `coinbase` integration lets you access account balances and exchange rates from [coinbase](https://coinbase.com).

You will need to obtain an API key from coinbase's [developer site](https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api) to use this component. You need to give read access to `wallet:accounts` in order for the integration to access relevant data.

## Configuration

To set it up, add the following information to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
coinbase:
  api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
  api_secret: YOUR_API_SECRET
```

{% configuration %}
api_key:
  description: Your API key to access coinbase.
  required: true
  type: string
api_secret:
  description: Your API secret to access coinbase.
  required: true
  type: string
account_balance_currencies:
  description: List of currencies to create account wallet sensors for.
  required: false
  type: list
  default: all account wallets
exchange_rate_currencies:
  description: List of currencies to create exchange rate sensors for.
  required: false
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

Possible currencies are codes that conform to the ISO 4217 standard where possible. Currencies which have or had no representation in ISO 4217 may use a custom code (e.g. BTC). A list of values can be obtained via https://api.coinbase.com/v2/currencies, for more information visit [the Coinbase API documentation](https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2#get-currencies).
