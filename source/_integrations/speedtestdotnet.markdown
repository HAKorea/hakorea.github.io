The `speedtestdotnet` integration uses the [Speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net/) web service to measure network bandwidth performance.

Enabling this integration will automatically create Speedtest.net sensors for the monitored conditions (below).

By default, a speed test will be run every hour. The user can change the update frequency in the configuration by defining the `scan_interval` for a speed test to run.

Most Speedtest.net servers require TCP port 8080 outbound to function. Without this port open you may experience significant delays or no results at all. See note on their [help page](https://www.speedtest.net/help).

## Configuration

For the `server_id` check the list of [available servers](http://www.speedtestserver.com).

To add Speedtest.net sensors to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

Once per hour, on the hour (default):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
speedtestdotnet:
```

{% configuration %}
monitored_conditions:
  description: Sensors to display in the frontend.
  required: false
  default: All keys
  type: list
  keys:
    ping:
      description: "Reaction time in ms of your connection (how fast you get a response after you've sent out a request)."
    download:
      description: "The download speed (Mbit/s)."
    upload:
      description: "The upload speed (Mbit/s)."
server_id:
  description: Specify the speed test server to perform the test against.
  required: false
  type: integer
scan_interval:
  description: "Minimum time interval between updates. Supported formats: `scan_interval: 'HH:MM:SS'`, `scan_interval: 'HH:MM'` and Time period dictionary (see example below)."
  required: false
  default: 60 minutes
  type: time
manual:
  description: "`true` or `false` to turn manual mode on or off. Manual mode will disable scheduled speed tests."
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: false
{% endconfiguration %}

### Time period dictionary example

```yaml
scan_interval:
  # At least one of these must be specified:
  days: 0
  hours: 0
  minutes: 3
  seconds: 30
  milliseconds: 0
```

### Service

Once loaded, the `speedtestdotnet` integration will expose a service (`speedtestdotnet.speedtest`) that can be called to run a Speedtest.net speed test on demand. This service takes no parameters. This can be useful if you have enabled manual mode.

```yaml
action:
  service: speedtestdotnet.speedtest
```

This integration uses [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) to gather network performance data from Speedtest.net.
Please be aware of the potential [inconsistencies](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli#inconsistency) that this integration may display.

When Home Assistant first starts up, the values of the speed test sensors will show as `Unknown`. You can use the service `speedtestdotnet.speedtest` to run a manual speed test and populate the data or just wait for the next regularly scheduled test. You can turn on manual mode to disable the scheduled speed tests.

## Examples

In this section you will find some real-life examples of how to use this component.

### Run periodically

Every half hour of every day:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
speedtestdotnet:
  scan_interval:
    minutes: 30
  monitored_conditions:
    - ping
    - download
    - upload
```

### Using as a trigger in an automation

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
automation:
  - alias: "Internet Speed Glow Connect Great"
    trigger:
      - platform: template
        value_template: "{{ states('sensor.speedtest_download')|float >= 10 }}"
    action:
      - service: shell_command.green

  - alias: "Internet Speed Glow Connect Poor"
    trigger:
      - platform: template
        value_template: "{{ states('sensor.speedtest_download')|float < 10 }}"
    action:
      - service: shell_command.red
```
{% endraw %}

## Notes

- When running on Raspberry Pi the maximum speed is limited by the LAN adapter. The Raspberry Pi 3+ models come with a Gigabit LAN adapter which supports a [maximum throughput](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) of 300 Mbit/s.
- Running this integration can have negative effects on the system's performance as it requires a fair amount of memory.
- Entries under `monitored_conditions` only control which entities are available in Home Assistant, they do not disable conditions from running.
- If run frequently, this integration has the ability to use a considerable amount of data. Frequent updates should be avoided on bandwidth-capped connections.
- While the speedtest is running your network capacity is fully utilized. This may have a negative effect on other devices using the network such as gaming consoles or streaming boxes.
