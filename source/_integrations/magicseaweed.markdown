The `magicseaweed` platform uses the [Magicseaweed Forecast API](https://magicseaweed.com/developer/forecast-api) as a source for surf forecasting data for the surf spots of your choice.

## Setup

You need an API key which is free but requires [registration](https://magicseaweed.com/developer/sign-up). Magicseaweed is limiting users of the API to 1 spot for the free plan.

## Configuration

To add Magicseaweed forecasts to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
