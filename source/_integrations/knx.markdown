The [KNX](https://www.knx.org) integration for Home Assistant allows you to connect to a KNX/IP devices.

The integration requires a local KNX/IP interface like the [Weinzierl 730](https://www.weinzierl.de/index.php/en/all-knx/knx-devices-en/produktarchiv-en/knx-ip-interface-730-en). Through this, it will send and receive commands to and from other devices to the KNX bus.

<div class='note warning'>
Please note, the `knx` platform does not support Windows.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary Sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor.knx)
- [Cover](/integrations/cover.knx)
- [Sensor](/integrations/sensor.knx)
- [Switch](/integrations/switch.knx)
- [Light](/integrations/light.knx)
- [Thermostat](/integrations/climate.knx)
- [Notify](/integrations/notify.knx)
- [Scene](/integrations/scene.knx)

## Configuration

To use your KNX in your installation, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
knx:
```

Optional, recommended for large KNX installations (>100 devices) and/or if you want to use the XKNX abstraction also for other scripted tools outside of Home Assistant:

```yaml
knx:
  config_file: '/path/to/xknx.yaml'
```
{% configuration %}
config_file:
  description: The path for XKNX configuration file.
  required: false
  type: string
rate_limit:
  description: Defines the maximum number of telegrams to be sent to the bus per second (range 1-100).
  required: false
  default: 20
  type: integer
{% endconfiguration %}

If the auto detection of the KNX/IP device does not work you can specify ip/port of the tunneling device:

```yaml
knx:
  tunneling:
    host: '192.168.2.23'
    port: 3671
    local_ip: '192.168.2.109'
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: Host of the KNX/IP tunneling device.
  type: string
  required: true
port:
  description: Port of the KNX/IP tunneling device.
  type: integer
  required: false
local_ip:
  description: IP of the local interface.
  type: string
  required: false
{% endconfiguration %}

Explicit connection to a KNX/IP routing device:

```yaml
knx:
  routing:
     local_ip: '192.168.2.109'
```

{% configuration %}
local_ip:
  description: The local IP address of interface (which should be used for multicasting).
  type: string
  required: true
{% endconfiguration %}

```yaml
knx:
  fire_event: true
  fire_event_filter: ["1/0/*", "6/2,3,4-6/*"]
```

{% configuration %}
fire_event:
  description: If set to True, platform will write all received KNX messages to event bus
  required: inclusive
  type: boolean
  default: false
fire_event_filter:
  description: If `fire_event` is set `fire_event_filter` has to be specified. `fire_event_filter` defines a list of patterns for filtering KNX addresses. Only telegrams which match this pattern are sent to the HOme Assistant event bus.
  required: inclusive
  type: [list, string]
state_updater:
  description: The integration will collect the current state of each configured device from the KNX bus to display it correctly within Home-Assistant. Set this option to False to prevent this behavior.
  required: false
  default: true
  type: boolean
{% endconfiguration %}

### Services

In order to directly interact with the KNX bus, you can use the following service:

```txt
Domain: knx
Service: send
Service Data: {"address": "1/0/15", "payload": 0}
```

{% configuration %}
address:
  description: KNX group address
  type: string
payload:
  description: Payload, either an integer or an array of integers
  type: [integer, list]
{% endconfiguration %}

### Exposing sensor values or time to knx bus

KNX integration is able to expose time or sensor values to KNX bus. The integration will broadcast any change of the exposed value to the KNX bus and answer read requests to the specified group address:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  expose:
    - type: 'temperature'
      entity_id: 'sensor.owm_temperature'
      address: '0/0/2'
    - type: 'string'
      address: '0/6/4'
      entity_id: "sensor.owm_weather"
    - type: 'binary'
      entity_id: 'binary_sensor.kitchen_window'
      address: '0/6/5'
    - type: 'time'
      address: '0/0/1'
    - type: 'datetime'
      address: '0/0/23'
```

{% configuration %}
type:
  description: Type of the exposed value. Either 'binary', 'time', 'date', 'datetime' or any supported type of [KNX Sensor](/integrations/sensor.knx/) (e.g., "temperature" or "humidity").
  type: string
  required: true
entity_id:
  description: Entity id to be exposed. Not needed for types time, date and datetime.
  type: string
address:
  description: KNX group address.
  type: string
  required: true
{% endconfiguration %}
