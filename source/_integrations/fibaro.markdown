The [Fibaro](https://fibaro.com/) hub is a controller mainly connecting to Z-Wave devices.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor
- Cover
- Climate
- Light
- Sensor
- Scene
- Switch

They will be automatically added when the `fibaro` hub is connected to Home Assistant.

## Configuration

To use Fibaro devices in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file using the IP and port number of your Fibaro controller:

```yaml
fibaro:
  gateways:
    - url: http://192.168.1.161/api/
      username: your_username
      password: your_password
      device_config:
        light_device_name_123:
          color: false
          white_value: false
          reset_color: true
        binary_device_name_123:
          device_class: "garage_door"
          icon: mdi:open
```

{% configuration %}

  required: false
  type: list
  default: None
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note'>

  It is recommended to assign a static IP address to your Fibaro controller. This ensures that it won't change its IP address, so you won't have to change the `url` if the controller reboots and comes up with a different IP address. See your router's manual for details on how to set this up. If you need the MAC address of your Fibaro, check the label on the bottom.

### Using Z-Wave devices in automation

If you want to use a Z-Wave device from the Fibaro controller in Home Assistant automation, you'll need the entity id. In the Home Assistant UI you'll find all entities listed under the <img src='/images/screenshots/developer-tool-states-icon.png' alt='service developer tool icon' class="no-shadow" height="38" /> icon of the Developer Tools section. Look for entities that contain 'fibaro_id' in their attributes, and you'll find the entity id on the left.
