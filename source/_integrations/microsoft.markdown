The `microsoft` text-to-speech platform uses [Microsoft Text-to-Speech engine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech/home) to read a text with natural sounding voices. This integration uses an API that is part of the Cognitive Services offering and is known as the Bing Speech API.
You will need an API key, which is free. You can use your [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com) or get an API key on the [Cognitive Services site](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/).

## Configuration

To enable text-to-speech with Microsoft, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
tts:
  - platform: microsoft
    api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

{% configuration %}
api_key:
  description: Your API key.
  required: true
  type: string
language:
  description: The language to use. Note that if you set the language to anything other than the default, you will need to specify a matching voice type as well.
