device_tracker:
  - platform: ubee
    host: ROUTER_IP_ADDRESS
    username: YOUR_ADMIN_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
model:

<div class='note info'>

This integration uses <a href='https://github.com/mzdrale/pyubee'>pyUbee library</a>, which was tested with models listed above. If you have different model of <a href='http://www.ubeeinteractive.com/?page_id=20178'>Ubee Router</a> and it doesn't work with this component, please <a href='https://github.com/mzdrale/pyubee/issues/new'>create pyUbee issue</a> to request for support for your model.

By default, Home Assistant pulls information about connected devices from Ubee router every 5 seconds.
See the [device tracker integration page](/integrations/device_tracker/) for instructions on how to configure the people to be tracked.
