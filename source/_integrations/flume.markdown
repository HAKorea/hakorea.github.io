The `flume` sensor will show you the current [flume](https://portal.flumetech.com/) status for the given Device ID.

Flume monitors the real-time status of your home water meter. Allowing the end-user to detect small leaks, gain real-time information on household water consumption, set water goals and budgets, and receive push notifications when suspicious water activities occur. 

## Configuration

You can find your Client ID and Client Secret under "API Access" on the [settings page](https://portal.flumetech.com/#settings).
