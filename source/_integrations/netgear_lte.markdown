The Netgear LTE integration for Home Assistant allows you to observe and control [Netgear LTE modems](https://www.netgear.com/home/products/mobile-broadband/lte-modems/default.aspx).

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Notifications
- Sensors
- Binary Sensors

The integration supports sending notifications with SMS, reporting incoming SMS with events and reporting the modem and connection state in a number of sensors and binary sensors.

<div class='note'>

Splitting of long SMS messages is not supported so notifications can contain a maximum of 70 characters. Simple messages using the reduced GSM-7 alphabet can contain up to 160 characters. Most emojis are not supported.

## Configuration

To enable the integration, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml

## Examples

{% raw %}
```yaml

  - alias: SMS conversation
    trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: netgear_lte_sms
    action:
      - service: conversation.process
        data_template:

        data_template:
          host: '{{ trigger.event.data.host }}'
          sms_id: '{{ trigger.event.data.sms_id }}'
