#### Create an input_boolean in your configuration.yaml 

```yaml
input_boolean:
  trigger_first_morning:
    name: Waiting for first morning motion
    icon: mdi:kettle
```

#### The Main Automation 

```yaml
## These first two control t input_boolean that allows the "first morning action" to occur
## If the action is triggered, it will also disable this boolean. This assumes you have the sun platform enabled.

automation:
#turns it on at 5am
  - alias: Enable First Morning Trigger
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: '05:00:00'
    action:
      service: homeassistant.turn_on
      entity_id: input_boolean.trigger_first_morning

# turns it off an hour after sunrise
  - alias: Disable First Morning Trigger
    trigger:
      - platform: sun
        event: sunrise
        offset: "01:00:00"
    action:
      service: homeassistant.turn_off
      entity_id: input_boolean.trigger_first_morning



# This is the main automation. It triggers when my motion sensor is triggered
# (in this case, a motion sensor from a security system attached to my Vera)
  - alias: First Morning Motion
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.livingroom_motion
      to: 'on'
    # only complete the automation if we're still waiting for the first motion
    condition:
        condition: state
        entity_id: input_boolean.trigger_first_morning
        state: 'on'

    action:
      # turn off the "waiting" boolean regardless of whether lights will turn on
      # so that this happens only once
      - service: homeassistant.turn_off
        entity_id: input_boolean.trigger_first_morning

      # But only turn on lights if the living room and kitchen lights are off or dimmed
      # If a condition tests false, the automation will end
      - condition: and
        conditions:
          - condition: numeric_state
            entity_id: light.livingroom_ec
            # if light is off, force a 0, otherwise use the brightness value
            value_template: {% raw %}'{% if is_state('light.livingroom_ec', 'on')  %}{{ state_attr('light.livingroom_ec', 'brightness') }}{% else %}0{% endif %}'{% endraw %}
            # brightness below 50% (255 = 100%)
            below: 128
          - condition: numeric_state
            entity_id: light.kitchen_bar
            value_template: {% raw %}'{% if is_state('light.kitchen_bar', 'on')  %}{{ state_attr('light.kitchen_bar', 'brightness') }}{% else %}0{% endif %}'{% endraw %}
            below: 128
          - condition: numeric_state
            entity_id: light.kitchen_ceiling
            value_template: {% raw %}'{% if is_state('light.kitchen_ceiling', 'on')  %}{{ state_attr('light.kitchen_ceiling', 'brightness') }}{% else %}0{% endif %}'{% endraw %}
            below: 128

      # Trigger a scene
      # You could add as many services or scenes as you'd like
      - service: scene.turn_on
        entity_id: scene.morning_first_motion


```

#### The Scene

Here is the Scene that is called via the Automations above.

```yaml
# here's the scene that gets called. Lights in
# my living room and kitchen turn on.
scene:
  - name: Morning First Motion
    entities:
      light.kitchen_ceiling:
        state: on
        brightness: 127
      light.kitchen_bar:
        state: on
        brightness: 178
      light.kitchen_above_cabinet:
        state: on
        brightness: 178
      light.livingroom_ec:
        state: on
        brightness: 153
      light.livingroom_track:
        state: on
        brightness: 153
```
