The following example sends a notification via XMPP if a new Home Assistant release is available:

```yaml
notify:
  - platform: xmpp
    name: jabber
    sender: sender@jabber.org
    password: !secret xmpp_password
    recipient: recipient@jabber.org

automation:
  - alias: Update notification
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.updater
        from: 'off'
        to: 'on'
    action:
      - service: notify.jabber
        data:
          message: 'There is a new Home Assistant release available.'
```

You can use [templates](/topics/templating/) to include the release number of Home Assistant if you prefer. The following example sends a notification via [Pushbullet](/integrations/pushbullet) with the Home Assistant version in the message.

```yaml
notify:
  - platform: pushbullet
    api_key: 'YOUR_KEY_HERE'
    name: pushbullet

automation:
  - alias: Update notification
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.updater
        from: 'off'
        to: 'on'
    action:
      - service: notify.pushbullet
        data_template: 
          title: 'New Home Assistant Release'
          target: 'YOUR_TARGET_HERE' #See Pushbullet integration for usage
          message: "Home Assistant {% raw %} {{ state_attr('binary_sensor.updater', 'newest_version') }} {% endraw %} is now available."
```
