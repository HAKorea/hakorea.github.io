{% configuration %}
text:
  required: false
  description: Text to present in the confirmation dialog.
  type: string
exemptions:
  required: false
  description: "List of `exemption` objects. See below"
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

## Options For Exemptions

{% configuration badges %}
user:
  required: true
  description: User id that can see the view tab.
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Examples

Navigate to another view:

```yaml
type: picture
image: /local/home.jpg
tap_action:
  action: navigate
  navigation_path: /lovelace/home
```

Check the [views](/lovelace/views/) setup on how to setup custom IDs.

Toggle entity using a service:

```yaml
type: picture
image: /local/light.png
service: light.toggle
service_data:
  entity_id: light.ceiling_lights
```
