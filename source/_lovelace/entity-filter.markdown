This card allows you to define a list of entities that you want to track only when in a certain state. Very useful for showing lights that you forgot to turn off or show a list of people only when they're at home.

This type of card can also be used together with rest of cards that allow multiple entities, allowing you to use [glance](/lovelace/glance/) or [picture-glance](/lovelace/picture-glance/). By default it uses [entities](/lovelace/entities/) card model.
