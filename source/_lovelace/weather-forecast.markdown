The weather forecast is a card to display the weather. Very useful to include on interfaces that people display on the wall.

Example

```

<div class="note">

  This card works only with platforms that define a `weather` entity.
  
  E.g., it works with [Dark Sky](/integrations/weather.darksky/) but not [Dark Sky Sensor](/integrations/darksky)
